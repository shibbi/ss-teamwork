    - You don't need to be the one being dragged around.

    - Aren't you satisfied with your performance?

    - 21
  - - 795
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.772292'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.772292'
    - I would've tried to find something that fits me.
    - Armati is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't
      start soccer. Let's join them.
    - 21
  - - 796
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.774812'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.774812'
    - Skipping practice isn't something that's in her dictionary.
    - The team is saying bad things about Armati for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 21
  - - 797
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.777322'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.777322'

      That'd be perfect.

      of the Iron Canyon.
    - 21
  - - 798
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.780865'

    - "(I want my dreams to come true.)"
    - Armati is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe.
      What do you tell him?
    - 21
  - - 801
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.793220'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.793220'
    - What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 21
  - - 802
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.800877'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.800877'
    - It was pretty scary watching you so pleased with the rough plays of the opponents.
    - Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Armel is asking how she did in
      the match.
    - 22
  - - 803
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.805732'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.805732'
    - I like cats. I like the egoistic side of them.
    - Armel looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around
      and asks you what kind of pet you like.
    - 22
  - - 804
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.820413'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.820413'
    - I'm sure you can find pleasure inside of the violence of the field.
    - You come across Armel thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell
      her?
    - 22
  - - 805
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.823050'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.823050'
    - You will be happy, while that feeling lasts.
    - Armel is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion
      she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What should
      we say?
    - 22
  - - 806
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.825549'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.825549'
    - Hmm, I'll prepare a rougher match.
    - Armel blushes up and tells you that she's happy she can play soccer with you.
      What should we tell her?
    - 22
  - - 807
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.828039'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.828039'
    - Good. I'll train you until you can't stand up.
    - Armel is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied with
      today's performance. What should we tell her?
    - 22
  - - 808
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.832025'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.832025'
    - That wasn't enough! You have to try harder!
    - Armel did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks
      sad. We should say something to her.
    - 22
  - - 809
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.835561'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.835561'
    - Boxing. I like that feeling when I get hit by a punch.
    - Armel is asking you about what you like besides soccer.
    - 22
  - - 810
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.838900'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.838900'
    - "...Do you want to spend the rest of your life being with an abusive herbivore
      like alien creature?"

    - 22
  - - 811
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.843876'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.843876'
    - Let's make him put on Armel's underwear.
    - Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk
      with Armel about what to do with him.
    - 22
  - - 812
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.851511'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.851511'
    - "(She looks happy. Let's let her be.)"
    - Armel continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing.
      What should we do?
    - 22
  - - 813
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.856607'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.856607'

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.870893'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.870893'
    - "(Tell her to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate.)"
    - It's dinner time and Armel is staring at her carrot soup with a troubled look.
      What should we do?
    - 22
  - - 815
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.873680'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.873680'
    - "(Step on everyone that's still sleeping.)"
    - It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking
      up for the morning training. What should we tell Armel to do?
    - 22
  - - 816
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.876306'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.876306'
    - It's fine. Eat up.

    - 22
  - - 817
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.878854'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.878854'
    - The tougher it gets, the better it feels to win. Right?
    - Armel is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should
      we stop her?
    - 22
  - - 818
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.882500'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.882500'

    - 22
  - - 819
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.886497'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.886497'

    - 22
  - - 820
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.889835'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.889835'
    - "(Slap the player in the back of the head.)"
    - During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.910284'
    - I think they're also mesmerized by you. You have a charm that matches a demon...
    - Armel is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during
      the match. It's your job to defend your teammates.
    - 22
  - - 824
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.922646'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.922646'
    - Yeah. The sight of you running on the field was marvelous.
    - Being too excited, Armel is overreacting while talking about the game. It seems
      she wants people to agree with her.

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.936377'
    - It'll sure be dangerous, but I think it'll be a place full of thrills and wonders.
    - Armel heard stories about the world of the demons and asks what you think it'll
      be like.

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.974651'
    - Nobody can resist that charm of yours.
    - A defender on the other team seems to have fallen in love with Armel and is
      chasing her around the field. It looks like the player forgot about the match.
      What should we do?
    - 22
  - - 835
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:52.977458'

    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Avnore is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams

      become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 25
  - - 948
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.607281'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.607281'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.626934'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.626934'

    - 25
  - - 952
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.629565'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.629565'

      will your response be?

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.658055'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.

    - 25
  - - 959
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.671058'

    - 25
  - - 962
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.678996'

  - - 963
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.682115'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.682115'
    - I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background.
      Are you interested in hearing about it?
    - Azrael is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 26

    - I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.
    - Azrael seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.689676'
    - That team is far from your style.

      any problems.
    - 26
  - - 966
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.694355'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.694355'

      advice.

  - - 967
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.701547'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.701547'

    - Azrael is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are

    - 26
  - - 968
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.707974'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.707974'
    - A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:53.807069'

    - It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.877651'
    - I feel like he's mocking us!
    - A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk
      about this with Brett.
    - 41
  - - 1677
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.881367'

    - Brett lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
    - 41
  - - 1679
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.887728'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.887728'
    - We'll win next time!
    - You come across Sammy while walking the street with Brett. Let's talk to her.

    - 41
  - - 1681
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.895582'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.895582'
    - Drink it up!
    - Brett brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team.

    - 41
  - - 1682
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.900014'

      him?
    - 42
  - - 1683
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.917042'

    - It's within our grasp.
    - Cassiel seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the

    - 42
  - - 1685
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.922750'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.922750'

      advice.

      are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 42
  - - 1688
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.932327'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.932327'
    - We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.
    - Cassiel is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to him.
    - 42
  - - 1689
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.935214'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.935214'
    - Are you giving up before putting up a fight?

      by vicious aliens.
    - 42
  - - 1690
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.938282'

    - This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?
    - Cassiel is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their
      soccer skills.
    - 42
  - - 1691
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.942019'

    - No, it's not boring.
    - Cassiel is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What
      should we say to him?
    - 42
  - - 1692

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.947244'
    - Don't give up until the end.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Cassiel is complaining that we're up against an
      opponent that's too strong.
    - 42
  - - 1693

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.951559'
    - It's my fault.
    - You forgot to lock Cassiel and almost used him as training material! He looks
      very upset!
    - 42
  - - 1694
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.968692'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.968692'
    - You deserve it. Well done!

    - I would've been doing something to save the universe.
    - Cassiel is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't

    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.980175'
    - Do you really think that he would skip practice?
    - The team is saying bad things about Cassiel for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 42
  - - 1697
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.994437'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:57.994437'

    - Let's go look for him.

      What do you tell him?
    - 42
  - - 1701
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.030616'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.030616'
    - Let's split up and find the uniforms.
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 42
  - - 1702
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.037467'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.037467'
    - Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!
    - You come across Cassiel, who was overwhelmed by his opponent throughout the
      game. Let's cheer him up.
    - 42
  - - 1703
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.042840'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.042840'
    - I'm not comfortable with this conversation.
    - Cassiel is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
    - 42
  - - 1704
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.054062'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.054062'
    - To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
    - Cassiel, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding
      that you reveal what your agenda really is. What should we say?
    - 42
  - - 1705
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.060535'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.060535'
    - Let's do our best until the very end!
    - Cassiel says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's
      give him an answer.
    - 42
  - - 1706
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.076624'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.076624'
    - I won't rely on Spirit Stones.
    - You're having a conversation with Cassiel about the power of Spirit Stones which
      is covered in secrets. Let's tell him what you think.
    - 42
  - - 1707
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.081090'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.081090'

    - 42
  - - 1708
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.084764'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.084764'
    - It's a place to rest for the good.
    - Let's talk to Cassiel who recently started to take interest in the world of
      angels.
    - 42

    - The teammates are speaking highly of Cassiel, saying he's a good role model.
      Let's add in.
    - 42
  - - 1711
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.096067'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.096067'
    - I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
    - You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about
      their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
    - 42
  - - 1712
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.100361'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.100361'
    - Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong
      team! Keep your heads up high!
    - Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars
      of Minerva. Cassiel wants to say a word.
    - 42
  - - 1713
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.116576'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.116576'
    - So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.
    - You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are
      playing a friendly match.
    - 42
  - - 1714
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.119353'

      What should we do?
    - 42
  - - 1715
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.122107'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.122107'
    - Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?
    - The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the
      next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing
      for your next opponent. What should we say?
    - 42
  - - 1716
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.124908'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.124908'

    - Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.
    - Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Cassiel seems to
      be surprised.
    - 42
  - - 1718
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.131025'

    - Don't fall for this cheap shot.
    - Cracsus threatens to hack Cassiel's personal information and reveal it to the
      world. What should we do?
    - 42
  - - 1720
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.136957'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.136957'

    - 42
  - - 1722
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.143062'

    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Castor seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the

  - - 1725
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.166116'
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.166116'

  - - 1728
    - '2017-07-03 04:18:58.174308'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.381971'

    - It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.481449'

    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some
      advice.
    - 59
  - - 2407
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.535564'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.746649'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.746649'
    - We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.
    - Nute went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we
      do?
    - 59
  - - 2437
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.749485'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.749485'
    - Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
    - Nute claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What
      could be the case?
    - 59
  - - 2438
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.752702'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.752702'

    - 59
  - - 2439
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.755623'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.755623'
    - Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
    - Nute says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the
      team members.
    - 59

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.762343'
    - "(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)"
    - You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with
      a surprise and Nute hands you a present.
    - 59
  - - 2441
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.772348'

    - Maybe she's up to something.
    - Nute says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give

    - 59
  - - 2442
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.793143'

    - Teamwork is what matters the most.
    - Dale is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
    - 60
  - - 2443
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.796366'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.796366'
    - I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background.
      Are you interested in hearing about it?
    - Dale is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 60
  - - 2444
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.799415'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.799415'
    - I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.
    - Dale seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe.
      He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 60
  - - 2445
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.802839'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.802839'
    - That team is far from your style.
    - Dale is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing
      any problems.
    - 60
  - - 2446
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.805820'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.805820'
    - Is winning really worth going that far?
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some
      advice.
    - 60
  - - 2447
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.813673'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.813673'
    - I..Respect your naming taste...
    - Dale is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are
      ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 60
  - - 2448
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.825275'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.825275'
    - A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.
    - Dale is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to him.
    - 60
  - - 2449
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.831837'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.831837'
    - Vicious? More like ugly.
    - Dale is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by
      vicious aliens.
    - 60
  - - 2450
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.849393'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.849393'
    - Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.
    - Dale is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer
      skills.
    - 60
  - - 2451
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.852552'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.852552'
    - If you're up for suggestions, I'm all ears.
    - Dale is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to him?
    - 60
  - - 2452
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.855457'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.855457'
    - We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Dale is complaining that we're up against an opponent
      that's too strong.
    - 60
  - - 2453
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.860926'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.860926'
    - It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!
    - You forgot to lock Dale and almost used him as training material! He looks very
      upset!
    - 60
  - - 2454
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.869941'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.869941'
    - Aren't you satisfied with your performance?
    - Dale is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
    - 60
  - - 2455
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.877831'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.877831'
    - I would've tried to find something that fits me.
    - Dale is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't
      start soccer. Let's join them.
    - 60
  - - 2456
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.893536'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.893536'
    - Skipping practice isn't something that's in his dictionary.
    - The team is saying bad things about Dale for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 60
  - - 2457
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.896761'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.896761'
    - Hmm...If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales.
      That'd be perfect.
    - Dale is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of
      the Iron Canyon.
    - 60
  - - 2458
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.899614'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.899614'
    - Everybody should grow up.
    - Dale seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel.
      Let's talk to him.
    - 60
  - - 2459
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.902510'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.902510'
    - It's really hard to find the right person.
    - On a day off, Dale is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
    - 60
  - - 2460
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.905518'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.905518'
    - "(I want my dreams to come true.)"
    - Dale is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What
      do you tell him?
    - 60
  - - 2461
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.909545'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.909545'
    - What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 60
  - - 2462
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.918930'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.918930'
    - This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!
    - The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences.
      Dale asks how you feel. How should we answer?
    - 60
  - - 2463
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.926036'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.926036'
    - Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!
    - Dale suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be
      your reaction?
    - 60
  - - 2464
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.950699'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.950699'
    - "(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)"
    - Dale is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.
    - 60
  - - 2465
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.953511'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.953511'
    - Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that
      going.
    - Dale has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side.
      He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.
    - 60
  - - 2466
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.956147'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.956147'
    - It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this
      universe.
    - As Dale said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the
      Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.
    - 60
  - - 2467
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.961229'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.961229'
    - They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.
    - The crowd is cheering for Dale. Dale seems to find this situation new and a
      bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.
    - 60
  - - 2468
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.969732'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.969732'
    - I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!
    - Dale is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to
      him.
    - 60
  - - 2469
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.976124'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.976124'
    - We can play soccer with the penguins!
    - Dale was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin
      himself. Let's talk to him.
    - 60
  - - 2470
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.992041'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.992041'
    - We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
    - The team will not have a match for some time. Dale asks you about your plan.
    - 60
  - - 2471
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.996092'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:01.996092'
    - True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
    - It's a very intense match and Dale falls on the ground, but a player on the
      other team helps Dale up and the two exchange smiles.
    - 60
  - - 2472
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.020009'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.020009'
    - It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
    - 60
  - - 2473
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.022890'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.022890'
    - Save the energy for the match.
    - You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Dale having an intense staring
      contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
    - 60
  - - 2474
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.029470'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.029470'
    - The fans love your performance!
    - Dale is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.
    - 60
  - - 2475
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.034261'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.034261'
    - You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!
    - Dale scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate
      him!
    - 60
  - - 2476
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.038164'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.038164'
    - I feel like he's mocking us!
    - A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk
      about this with Dale.
    - 60
  - - 2477
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.054846'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.054846'
    - Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!
    - Dale falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say
      to him?
    - 60
  - - 2478
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.057810'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.057810'
    - I will avenge you!
    - Dale lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
    - 60
  - - 2479
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.065130'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.065130'
    - We'll win next time!
    - You come across Sammy while walking the street with Dale. Let's talk to her.
    - 60
  - - 2480
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.073426'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.073426'
    - Let's go help them!
    - Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Dale is curious
      and wants to take a look.
    - 60
  - - 2481
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.092378'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.092378'
    - Drink it up!
    - Dale brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team.
      It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
    - 60
  - - 2482
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.096383'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.096383'
    - They were a worthy opponent.
    - Damien is looking excited and asks how the match went.
    - 61
  - - 2483
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.120019'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.120019'
    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
    - This was the worst game in your entire life...Damien comes to you to cheer you
      up.
    - 61
  - - 2484
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.122978'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.122978'
    - I would say goodbye to all my friends.
    - You're talking to Damien about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow.
      Let's tell him your answer.
    - 61
  - - 2485
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.129343'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.129343'
    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Damien is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in
      the Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.
    - 61
  - - 2486
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.134574'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.134574'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Damien is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
    - 61
  - - 2487
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.138513'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.138513'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
    - Damien isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have
      become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 61
  - - 2488
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.155146'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.155146'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Damien for solutions.
    - 61
  - - 2489
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.158143'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.158143'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
    - The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
    - 61
  - - 2490
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.166472'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.166472'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Damien and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 61
  - - 2491
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.174764'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.174764'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 61
  - - 2492
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.193936'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.193936'
    - I thought they were just friends.
    - According to Damien's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
    - 61
  - - 2493
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.197135'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:02.197135'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.

  - - 2662
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:03.628559'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:03.751343'

      our names.

      you think has the brightest future. What will you say?

    - Ari (Swimsuit) says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good
      care of the team members.

    - "(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)"
    - You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with
      a surprise and Ari (Swimsuit) hands you a present.
    - 75
  - - 3081
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.678878'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.678878'
    - Maybe she's up to something.
    - Ari (Swimsuit) says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's

    - 75
  - - 3082
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.681740'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.681740'
    - Teamwork is what matters the most.
    - Ravi is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
    - 76
  - - 3083
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.684408'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.684408'
    - I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background.
      Are you interested in hearing about it?
    - Ravi is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 76
  - - 3084
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.687327'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.687327'
    - I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.
    - Ravi seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe.
      She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 76
  - - 3085
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.690587'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.690587'
    - That team is far from your style.
    - Ravi is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing
      any problems.
    - 76
  - - 3086
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.693833'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.693833'
    - Is winning really worth going that far?
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some
      advice.
    - 76
  - - 3087
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.698437'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.698437'
    - I..Respect your naming taste...
    - Ravi is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are
      ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 76
  - - 3088
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.702389'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.702389'
    - A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.
    - Ravi is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to her.
    - 76
  - - 3089
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.718383'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.718383'
    - Vicious? More like ugly.
    - Ravi is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive
      by vicious aliens.
    - 76
  - - 3090
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.722343'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.722343'
    - Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.
    - Ravi is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer
      skills.
    - 76
  - - 3091
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.726102'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.726102'
    - If you're up for suggestions, I'm all ears.
    - Ravi is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to her?
    - 76
  - - 3092
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.729705'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.729705'
    - We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Ravi is complaining that we're up against an opponent
      that's too strong.
    - 76
  - - 3093
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.732887'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.732887'
    - It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!
    - You forgot to lock Ravi and almost used her as training material! She looks
      very upset!
    - 76
  - - 3094
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.735574'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.735574'
    - Aren't you satisfied with your performance?
    - Ravi is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
    - 76
  - - 3095
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.739226'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.739226'
    - I would've tried to find something that fits me.
    - Ravi is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't
      start soccer. Let's join them.
    - 76
  - - 3096
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.742370'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.742370'
    - Skipping practice isn't something that's in her dictionary.
    - The team is saying bad things about Ravi for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 76
  - - 3097
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.746953'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.746953'
    - Hmm...If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales.
      That'd be perfect.
    - Ravi is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of
      the Iron Canyon.
    - 76
  - - 3098
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.751318'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.751318'
    - Everybody should grow up.
    - Ravi seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel.
      Let's talk to her.
    - 76
  - - 3099
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.767473'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.767473'
    - It's really hard to find the right person.
    - On a day off, Ravi is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
    - 76
  - - 3100
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.770918'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.770918'
    - "(I want my dreams to come true.)"
    - Ravi is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What
      do you tell him?
    - 76
  - - 3101
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.774764'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.774764'
    - What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 76
  - - 3102
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.778066'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.778066'
    - We need a decent level of personal performance.
    - Ravi is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's
      match. Let's give her an answer.
    - 76
  - - 3103
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.786615'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.786615'
    - I've never dreamt about soccer.
    - Ravi, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about
      soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
    - 76
  - - 3104
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.792004'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.792004'
    - I have faith in you.
    - Ravi announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league
      completely. Let's give her an answer.
    - 76
  - - 3105
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.796880'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.796880'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Ravi is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't
      be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 76
  - - 3106
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.801129'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.801129'
    - Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
    - Ravi wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She
      wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
    - 76
  - - 3107
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.818302'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.818302'
    - Ravi? Nah, she never gets lost.
    - It seems that Ravi is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
    - 76
  - - 3108
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.821248'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.821248'
    - Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
    - You find Ravi lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should
      we say?
    - 76
  - - 3109
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.824967'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.824967'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Ravi says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks
      Uriel is a very kind angel.
    - 76
  - - 3110
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.829142'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.829142'
    - We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very
      severe fever. What should we do?
    - 76
  - - 3111
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.832142'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.832142'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Ravi wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we
      do?
    - 76
  - - 3112
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.834794'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.834794'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
    - Ravi caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What
      should we do?
    - 76
  - - 3113
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.837658'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.837658'
    - Let's try out some forward passes.
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Ravi some orders.
    - 76
  - - 3114
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.840535'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.840535'
    - It's time we use him as training material.
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 76
  - - 3115
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.844339'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.844339'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Ravi seems to be worried.
    - 76
  - - 3116
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.848691'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.848691'
    - I hope that wasn't all you got.
    - Ravi came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
    - 76
  - - 3117
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.865757'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.865757'
    - "...We should get out of here."
    - James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her
      approach from a distance.
    - 76
  - - 3118
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.868495'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.868495'
    - It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
    - Ravi is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to
      cheer her up?
    - 76
  - - 3119
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.872027'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.872027'
    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Ravi seems to be sick of this.
    - 76
  - - 3120
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.875591'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.875591'
    - It's space. Anything can exist here.
    - Ravi looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
    - 76
  - - 3121
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.878487'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.878487'
    - Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their
      free time.
    - The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with
      Ravi to set some simple rules.
    - 76
  - - 3122
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.881276'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.881276'
    - Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
    - Vanity is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
    - 77
  - - 3123
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.883925'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.883925'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.886655'
    - Why don't you join them and find out?
    - Vanity wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should
      we answer?
    - 77
  - - 3125
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.889621'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.889621'
    - Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
    - Vanity is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one
      time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.

  - - 3126
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.892710'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.892710'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.897327'

    - 77
  - - 3128
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.901366'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.901366'
    - Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
    - This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want
      to do?
    - 77
  - - 3129
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.916929'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.916929'
    - He'll remember someday.
    - Vanity says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was
      revived.
    - 77
  - - 3130
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.919777'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.919777'
    - Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
    - The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to
      crush your team.
    - 77
  - - 3131
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.923214'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.923214'
    - I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
    - Vanity seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
    - 77
  - - 3132
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.926286'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.926286'
    - That must hurt.
    - Ogre's pony tail slapped Vanity in the face!
    - 77
  - - 3133
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.929085'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.929085'
    - Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
    - It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying
      his baby brother is born. What should you do?
    - 77
  - - 3134
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.931812'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.931812'
    - Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
    - Vanity is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've
      learned something during a match.
    - 77
  - - 3135
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.934509'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.934509'

    - Vanity says that the Swirlies are missing.
    - 77
  - - 3136
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.937212'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.937212'
    - Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing
      the ball.
    - Vanity says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What
      should we say to her?
    - 77
  - - 3137
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:05.940541'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:06.021520'
    - I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...
    - Vanity says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne
      is empty.

    - I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.

    - You will be happy, while that feeling lasts.
    - Elliot is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:07.424072'

    - That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
    - 86
  - - 3493
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:07.637161'

      to her?

    - The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...
    - Elua brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:07.683286'

      of this team.

      give her an answer.
    - 86
  - - 3506

      What should we do?

    - 87
  - - 3528
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:07.788091'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:07.829004'
    - Do you really think that she would skip practice?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:07.845752'
    - Let's split up and find the uniforms.

  - - 3542
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:07.850005'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:07.866789'

      her a sincere answer.
    - 87

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.627179'
    - I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.

    - 113
  - - 4613
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.630596'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.654958'

      like I told you...
    - Hines lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
    - 113
  - - 4619
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.670296'

      we answer?
    - 113

    - 113
  - - 4627
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.703321'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.723332'
    - What a depressing weather...
    - The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to
      crush your team.
    - 113
  - - 4631
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.727564'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.727564'

    - I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.
    - It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying

    - 113
  - - 4634
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.738831'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.738831'

    - 113

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.779223'

    - 113
  - - 4642
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:13.783690'

    - The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...
    - Irru brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team.

    - 123

    - Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
    - This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want
      to do?
    - 123
  - - 5029
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:15.947600'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:15.954026'

      crush your team.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:15.976604'
    - Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
    - It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying
      his baby brother is born. What should you do?
    - 123
  - - 5034
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:15.979385'

    - 123
  - - 5037

    - 123

    - 123
  - - 5042
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.032240'

    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
    - This was the worst game in your entire life...Isillia comes to you to cheer
      you up.
    - 124
  - - 5044
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.038043'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.038043'
    - I would say goodbye to all my friends.

    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Isillia is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in
      the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
    - 124
  - - 5046
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.053926'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.053926'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Isillia is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
    - 124
  - - 5047
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.058092'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.058092'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.

      have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 124
  - - 5048
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.071167'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.071167'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Isillia for
      solutions.
    - 124
  - - 5049
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.075326'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.075326'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.

    - 124
  - - 5050
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.078965'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.078965'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Isillia and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 124
  - - 5051
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.082889'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.082889'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 124
  - - 5052
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.086849'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.086849'
    - I thought they were just friends.
    - According to Isillia's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
    - 124
  - - 5053
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.091043'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.091043'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.

    - 124
  - - 5054
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.097623'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.097623'

    - 124
  - - 5055
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.101862'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.101862'
    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Isillia suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the
      baby angels live.
    - 124
  - - 5056
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.118690'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.118690'
    - Let's see what you have to say after the match.
    - The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team
      is better off playing foot volleyball.
    - 124
  - - 5057
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.122038'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.122038'
    - I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
    - You're sick and in bed when Isillia and the teammates come to cheer you up.
      What will your response be?
    - 124
  - - 5058
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.126520'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.126520'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
    - The match and the concert that Isillia was looking for start at the same time...
    - 124
  - - 5059
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.130963'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.130963'
    - Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.

    - 124
  - - 5061
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.139788'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.139788'
    - Looks like we'll have to do without her.
    - The match started and Isillia is standing still doing nothing.
    - 124
  - - 5062
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.144817'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.144817'
    - Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!

    - 124
  - - 5064
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.152845'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.152845'
    - To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
    - Isillia, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding
      that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?
    - 124

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:16.169559'
    - I won't rely on Spirit Stones.
    - You're having a conversation with Isillia about the power of Spirit Stones which
      is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.
    - 124
  - - 5067

      angels.
    - 124
  - - 5069

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.146638'
    - I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
    - Jay is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...

  - - 5244
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.151548'

    - You're right. This is a waste of time.
    - Jay is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing
      any problems.

    - I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.172074'
    - Cool! Keep it up!
    - Jay is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are

    - 129
  - - 5248

      vicious aliens.
    - 129
  - - 5250

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.183511'
    - It can't be perfect every time.
    - Jay is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer
      skills.
    - 129
  - - 5251
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.187210'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.187210'
    - How about we play baseball today?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.227550'

      the Iron Canyon.
    - 129
  - - 5258

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.231264'
    - It'll be alright. Don't worry.
    - Jay seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel.

  - - 5259
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.234709'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.243724'
    - It's finally time for some festival-soccer!
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 129
  - - 5262
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.249851'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:17.272318'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:18.173561'

    - 133
  - - 5434
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:18.220509'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:18.220509'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:18.233112'

      not our fault.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:18.639175'
    - I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing
      soccer.

      talk with him.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.120784'
    - I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance
      on the field.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.129130'
    - If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.
    - Jiho's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next
      match. What should we say to her?
    - 137
  - - 5597
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.132776'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.132776'
    - We have to keep on going.
    - During a match, Jiho bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She
      seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
    - 137
  - - 5598
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.136788'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.136788'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.155491'
    - This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.
    - Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying
      himself a little too much. Jiho is starting to get intimidated.
    - 137
  - - 5602
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.171573'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.171573'
    - It's a result of team effort.
    - Jiho is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
    - 137

    - I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.
    - After a meeting, Jiho's eyes met yours a several times and Jiho asks if she
      has something on her face.
    - 137
  - - 5604
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.177377'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.177377'

      the match.
    - 137

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.180020'
    - I can't pick just one...
    - Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Jiho on which player
      you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
    - 137
  - - 5606
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.184229'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.184229'
    - Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?
    - Jiho is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous
      things. What should we tell her?
    - 137
  - - 5607
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.188012'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.188012'
    - I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.
    - Jiho is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing.
      Let's talk to her.
    - 137
  - - 5608
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.191629'

    - Now we're starting to look like a team!
    - You find Jiho being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will
      you react?
    - 137
  - - 5610
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.204686'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.204686'

    - 137
  - - 5611
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.220601'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.220601'
    - I like how all of the Gate Keepers have different characteristics.
    - Jiho is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
    - 137
  - - 5612
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.223522'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.223522'
    - It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.

    - 137
  - - 5613
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.226187'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.226187'
    - Here! I made some cookies with the team.
    - It's Jiho's birthday. Let's give her a present.
    - 137
  - - 5614
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.228794'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.228794'
    - Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!
    - You see Jiho's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Jiho. What should
      we do?
    - 137
  - - 5615
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.232476'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.232476'
    - I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.
    - The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
    - 137
  - - 5616
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.236469'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.236469'
    - Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?
    - You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Jiho's rival, has been severely
      injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?
    - 137
  - - 5617
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.240353'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.240353'
    - There will always be a place for you to return.
    - Jiho comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal
      reasons. What should we say?
    - 137
  - - 5618
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.248380'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.248380'
    - We can overcome this with team effort.
    - Jiho is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with
      Jiho.
    - 137
  - - 5619
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.254938'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.254938'
    - I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear
      such stories.
    - Jiho is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because
      of the king.
    - 137
  - - 5620
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.271708'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.271708'
    - We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the
      ticket.
    - You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Jiho seems to be interested.
    - 137
  - - 5621
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.274509'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.274509'
    - I'll come up with a formation that can bring the best out of everybody.
    - Jiho says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't
      go down no matter how many shots she makes.
    - 137
  - - 5622
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.277396'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.277396'
    - We need a decent level of personal performance.
    - Jiho is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's
      match. Let's give her an answer.
    - 137
  - - 5623
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.280014'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.280014'
    - I've never dreamt about soccer.
    - Jiho, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about
      soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
    - 137
  - - 5624
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.284456'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.284456'
    - I have faith in you.
    - Jiho announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league

    - 137
  - - 5625
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.288190'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.288190'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Jiho is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't
      be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 137
  - - 5626
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.293194'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.293194'
    - Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
    - Jiho wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She
      wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
    - 137
  - - 5627
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.301301'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.301301'
    - Jiho? Nah, she never gets lost.
    - It seems that Jiho is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
    - 137
  - - 5628
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.306923'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.306923'
    - Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
    - You find Jiho lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should
      we say?
    - 137
  - - 5629
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.323150'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.323150'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Jiho says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks
      Uriel is a very kind angel.
    - 137
  - - 5630
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.326395'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.326395'
    - We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very
      severe fever. What should we do?
    - 137
  - - 5631
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.329269'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.329269'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Jiho wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we
      do?
    - 137
  - - 5632
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.333466'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.333466'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
    - Jiho caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What
      should we do?
    - 137
  - - 5633
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.338103'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.338103'
    - Let's try out some forward passes.
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Jiho some orders.
    - 137
  - - 5634
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.342226'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.342226'
    - It's time we use him as training material.
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 137
  - - 5635
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.349144'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.349144'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Jiho seems to be worried.
    - 137
  - - 5636
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.354871'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.354871'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.371186'
    - "...We should get out of here."

      approach from a distance.
    - 137
  - - 5638
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.374021'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.374021'
    - It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
    - Jiho is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to
      cheer her up?
    - 137
  - - 5639
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.376699'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.376699'
    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Jiho seems to be sick of this.
    - 137
  - - 5640
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.379420'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.379420'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.383011'
    - Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their
      free time.
    - The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with
      Jiho to set some simple rules.
    - 137
  - - 5642
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.387067'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.387067'
    - To win all the way, of course.
    - Jill is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
    - 138

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.390617'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.390617'
    - I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
    - Jill is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 138
  - - 5644
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.396636'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.396636'
    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Jill seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe.
      She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 138
  - - 5645
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.403733'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.403733'
    - You're right. This is a waste of time.
    - Jill is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing
      any problems.
    - 138
  - - 5646
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.421028'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.421028'
    - I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some
      advice.
    - 138
  - - 5647
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.423847'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.423847'
    - Cool! Keep it up!
    - Jill is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are
      ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 138
  - - 5648
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.426484'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.426484'

    - I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very
      severe fever. What should we do?
    - 139
  - - 5711
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.777446'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.777446'

    - You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.791141'
    - Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing
      here.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Jin seems to be worried.
    - 139

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.797599'

      him up?
    - 139
  - - 5719
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.823983'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.823983'
    - Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Jin!
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Jin seems to be sick of this.
    - 139
  - - 5720
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.826704'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.847172'
    - Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
    - Jin is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen
      during the match. Let's give him an answer.

    - Jin is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of
      angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
    - 139
  - - 5731
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.885262'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:19.885262'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.051248'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Kaidormu is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that
      can't be achieved. What should we say to him?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.080274'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Kaidormu says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.085653'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Kaidormu wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should
      we do?
    - 145
  - - 5952

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.089491'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.094050'

      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Kaidormu seems to be worried.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.130905'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.130905'
    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Kaidormu seems to be sick of this.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.157776'
    - Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
    - Kaidormu is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be
      seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.520809'
    - Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
    - It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying
      his baby brother is born. What should you do?
    - 147
  - - 6034
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:21.524684'

    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going

    - We have a strong lineup of players that make our star players shine brighter.

    - I know.
    - Kevin, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and
      says he didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?

  - - 6125
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.031729'

    - "(He wants you to be a good listener.)"

    - Patting you on the head? He must not fear for his life!
    - Kirin suddenly appears, pats Kevin on the head while teasing him, and then goes
      away. Kevin seems angry...

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.087830'
    - Well that's absolutely fine if you can actually prove that you're the best.
    - Kevin refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't

    - If your friend is truly your friend, he will understand.
    - Kevin looks sad because he feels his friendship with a friend in a rival team
      is falling apart. What should we say to him?
    - 149
  - - 6140
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.124165'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.128446'

    - I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
    - Khirel is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 150
  - - 6144
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.141635'

    - It's within our grasp.
    - Khirel seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the
      universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 150

    - 150
  - - 6148
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.171243'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.171243'

      by vicious aliens.
    - 150
  - - 6150
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.178544'

      soccer skills.
    - 150

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.182264'
    - No, it's not boring.
    - Khirel is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to him?
    - 150
  - - 6152
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.186809'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.186809'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.191578'
    - It's my fault.

      very upset!
    - 150
  - - 6154
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.197870'

    - I would've been doing something to save the universe.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.217745'
    - Do you really think that he would skip practice?
    - The team is saying bad things about Khirel for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 150
  - - 6157
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.220521'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.234961'
    - Let's split up and find the uniforms.
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 150
  - - 6162
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.238702'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.238702'
    - Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
    - Khirel seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling
      said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.243782'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.243782'
    - Being together is enough for me.
    - With a serious face, Khirel is asking what the true meaning of competition is.
      Let's give him an answer.
    - 150
  - - 6164
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.250817'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.250817'
    - I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
    - Khirel came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's
      boring strategy. What should we say?
    - 150
  - - 6165
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.255275'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.255275'
    - Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
    - Khirel is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be
      seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.

      of the universe.
    - 150
  - - 6168

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.284319'
    - Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
    - Khirel is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength
      of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
    - 150
  - - 6171
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.288296'

    - We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.

      to do.
    - 150
  - - 6173
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.300140'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.300140'

    - 150
  - - 6174
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.305078'

    - "...Uh...So no soccer?"

      up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
    - 150
  - - 6175
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:22.319906'

    - Khirel's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next
      match. What should we say to him?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:23.956670'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:23.975482'
    - Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
    - It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying
      his baby brother is born. What should you do?
    - 158
  - - 6474
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:23.983375'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:23.991397'
    - Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing
      the ball.
    - Lai Gayle says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match.
      What should we say to her?
    - 158
  - - 6477
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:23.998664'

    - 158

      her.
    - 158
  - - 6481

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.027226'
    - Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?
    - Lai Gayle thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
    - 158
  - - 6482
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.031015'

    - Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.
    - Lai Gayle is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that
      can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 158
  - - 6486
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.051799'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.075027'
    - Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?
    - Lai Gayle says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.077816'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.077816'
    - I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.088215'
    - Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Lai Gayle some
      orders.
    - 158
  - - 6494
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.091668'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.091668'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.099726'

      here.

    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Latios is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.170722'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.170722'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Latios is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams

    - 159
  - - 6508
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.176208'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.176208'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.

    - 159
  - - 6509
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.178839'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.178839'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
    - The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
    - 159
  - - 6510
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.183349'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.183349'
    - Let's give her some space.

    - 159
  - - 6512
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.192366'

    - 159
  - - 6514
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.205978'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.205978'

      baby angels live.
    - 159
  - - 6516

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.226806'
    - I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
    - You're sick and in bed when Latios and the teammates come to cheer you up. What
      will your response be?
    - 159
  - - 6518
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.229475'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.229475'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.

    - 159
  - - 6519
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.233467'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.240780'
    - Looks like we'll have to do without her.
    - The match started and Latios is standing still doing nothing.
    - 159
  - - 6522
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.247162'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.272188'
    - To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
    - Latios, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:24.277655'
    - I won't rely on Spirit Stones.
    - You're having a conversation with Latios about the power of Spirit Stones which
      is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.

    - Nobody can resist that charm of yours.
    - A defender on the other team seems to have fallen in love with Lilith and is

    - 166
  - - 6788
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:25.685284'

      by vicious aliens.

  - - 6910

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:26.376637'
    - It's my fault.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:26.379989'

  - - 6922
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:26.429111'

    - Wasn't that a glitch?
    - During a match, Lucifer bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He

    - It's within our grasp.
    - Lucius seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the

  - - 7185
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:27.894116'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:27.894116'

      advice.
    - 176
  - - 7187
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:27.905193'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:27.970434'

    - You come across Lucius who is limping. He says it's nothing. What should we
      do?
    - 176
  - - 7210
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.040979'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.040979'

    - That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on

    - 177
  - - 7233
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.174683'

    - Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing
      the ball.
    - Lulu says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What
      should we say to her?
    - 177
  - - 7257
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.320882'

    - I can't pick just one...

  - - 7266
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.370156'

      Luna.
    - 178

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.433227'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.475287'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Luna is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
    - 178
  - - 7287
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.477985'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.477985'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
    - Luna isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have
      become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 178
  - - 7288
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.482330'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.482330'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Luna for solutions.
    - 178
  - - 7289
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.486361'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.490905'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.498137'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.

    - 178
  - - 7292
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.504683'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:28.504683'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.503519'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Kainen wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should
      we do?
    - 183
  - - 7472
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.507694'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.507694'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
    - Kainen caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What
      should we do?
    - 183
  - - 7473

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.520415'
    - Let's try out some forward passes.
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Kainen some
      orders.
    - 183
  - - 7474
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.523285'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.523285'
    - It's time we use him as training material.
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 183
  - - 7475
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.526099'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.526099'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Kainen seems to be worried.
    - 183
  - - 7476
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.528757'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.528757'

    - 183

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.535864'
    - It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
    - Kainen is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to
      cheer him up?
    - 183
  - - 7479
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.539339'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.539339'
    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Kainen seems to be sick of this.
    - 183
  - - 7480
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.544428'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.544428'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.550486'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.550486'
    - Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their
      free time.

    - Teamwork is what matters the most.
    - Kainen is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell
      him?
    - 183
  - - 7483
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.571485'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.571485'
    - I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background.
      Are you interested in hearing about it?
    - Kainen is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 183
  - - 7484
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.574226'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.574226'
    - I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.
    - Kainen seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the
      universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 183
  - - 7485
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.576870'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.576870'
    - That team is far from your style.
    - Kainen is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing
      any problems.
    - 183
  - - 7486
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.579576'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.579576'
    - Is winning really worth going that far?
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some
      advice.
    - 183
  - - 7487
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.584572'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.584572'
    - I..Respect your naming taste...
    - Kainen is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are
      ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 183
  - - 7488
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.588228'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.588228'
    - A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.
    - Kainen is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to him.
    - 183
  - - 7489
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.593500'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.593500'
    - Vicious? More like ugly.
    - Kainen is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive
      by vicious aliens.
    - 183
  - - 7490
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.601901'

      soccer skills.

    - If you're up for suggestions, I'm all ears.
    - Kainen is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to him?
    - 183
  - - 7492
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.620976'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.620976'
    - We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Kainen is complaining that we're up against an
      opponent that's too strong.
    - 183
  - - 7493
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.624058'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.624058'
    - It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!
    - You forgot to lock Kainen and almost used him as training material! He looks
      very upset!
    - 183
  - - 7494
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.626727'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.626727'
    - Aren't you satisfied with your performance?
    - Kainen is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
    - 183
  - - 7495
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.629697'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.629697'
    - I would've tried to find something that fits me.
    - Kainen is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't
      start soccer. Let's join them.
    - 183
  - - 7496
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.634220'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.634220'
    - Skipping practice isn't something that's in his dictionary.
    - The team is saying bad things about Kainen for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 183
  - - 7497
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.638014'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.638014'
    - Hmm...If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales.
      That'd be perfect.
    - Kainen is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies
      of the Iron Canyon.

    - Everybody should grow up.
    - Kainen seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel.

    - 183
  - - 7499
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.650630'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.650630'
    - It's really hard to find the right person.
    - On a day off, Kainen is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
    - 183
  - - 7500
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.656033'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.656033'
    - "(I want my dreams to come true.)"

    - 183

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.671422'
    - What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 183
  - - 7502
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.674278'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.674278'
    - We need a decent level of personal performance.
    - Leventor is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's
      match. Let's give him an answer.
    - 184
  - - 7503
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.676902'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.676902'
    - I've never dreamt about soccer.
    - Leventor, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams,
      about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about
      it.
    - 184
  - - 7504
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.679530'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.682789'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Leventor is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that
      can't be achieved. What should we say to him?
    - 184
  - - 7506
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.686810'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.686810'

    - Leventor? Nah, he never gets lost.
    - It seems that Leventor is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
    - 184
  - - 7508
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.695857'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.695857'

      should we say?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.701723'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Leventor says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He
      thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
    - 184
  - - 7510
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.707188'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:29.707188'
    - We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very

    - It's experiences like this that bonds us together.

    - I'm not sure if it's safe, but we can use him for leveling up.

      not our fault.

    - It's within our grasp.
    - Mariel seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the
      universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 193
  - - 7945
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.128523'

      start soccer. Let's join them.
    - 193
  - - 7956
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.187075'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.187075'
    - Do you really think that she would skip practice?

    - 193
  - - 7962
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.225597'

    - Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.

    - You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.

    - 195
  - - 8023
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.573212'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.605453'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.680131'
    - It's finally time for some festival-soccer!
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.

    - 195
  - - 8042
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.684113'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.684113'

      answer.
    - 195

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.688394'
    - This could all be avoided if we become mesmerized by you. Do as you please.
    - May is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during
      the match. It's your job to defend your teammates.
    - 195
  - - 8044
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.695805'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:32.695805'

    - The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to
      crush your team.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:33.097228'
    - I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
    - Melchior seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
    - 197
  - - 8112
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:33.102598'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:33.102598'
    - That must hurt.
    - Ogre's pony tail slapped Melchior in the face!
    - 197
  - - 8113
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:33.106248'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:33.106248'
    - Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
    - It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying
      his baby brother is born. What should you do?
    - 197
  - - 8114
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:34.278487'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:34.278487'
    - Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
    - Melchior is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've
      learned something during a match.
    - 197
  - - 8115
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:34.309413'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:34.309413'

    - 197
  - - 8116
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.433988'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.433988'
    - Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing
      the ball.
    - Melchior says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match.
      What should we say to her?
    - 197
  - - 8117
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.438334'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.438334'
    - "...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that..."
    - You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe,
      flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
    - 197
  - - 8118
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.517583'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.517583'
    - Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
    - Melchior picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
    - 197
  - - 8119
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.699538'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.699538'
    - A crow?!

    - 197
  - - 8120
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.709811'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.709811'
    - It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
    - Melchior is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over
      her.
    - 197
  - - 8121
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.723483'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.723483'
    - Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?
    - Melchior thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
    - 197
  - - 8122
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.731815'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.731815'
    - I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.
    - Melchior says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How
      should we answer?
    - 197
  - - 8123
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.751567'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.751567'
    - I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.
    - Melchior asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give
      her a sincere answer.
    - 197
  - - 8124
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.757837'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.757837'
    - I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear.
    - Melchior is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form
      of different animals.
    - 197
  - - 8125
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.766318'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.766318'
    - The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.
    - Melchior looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should
      we say to her?
    - 197
  - - 8126
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.773239'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.773239'
    - They're young but they have passion.
    - Melchior says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give
      her an answer.
    - 197
  - - 8127
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.806723'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.806723'
    - Thankful beings that will be our +160.
    - Melchior wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
    - 197
  - - 8128
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.815656'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.815656'
    - How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe
      with the light within us?
    - Melchior is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up.
      Let's talk to her.
    - 197
  - - 8129
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.821799'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.821799'
    - Tell them they should remember that they play for you.
    - Melchior says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss
      streak.
    - 197
  - - 8130
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.827845'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.827845'
    - Did she think that you'll take over the throne?
    - Melchior says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne
      is empty.
    - 197
  - - 8131
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.839797'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.839797'
    - Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!
    - Melchior seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
    - 197
  - - 8132
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.847403'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.847403'
    - I don't think you need to worry about a diet.
    - Melchior is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
    - 197
  - - 8133
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.854758'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.854758'
    - Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.
    - Melchior says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
    - 197
  - - 8134
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.862932'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.862932'
    - You both need to be disciplined by Melchior.
    - Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Melchior seems to be troubled. What should
      we do?
    - 197
  - - 8135
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.876997'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.876997'

    - I feel sorry for the other team.
    - Melchior went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should
      we do?
    - 197
  - - 8137
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.886368'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.886368'
    - I don't care what the case is.
    - Melchior claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room.
      What could be the case?
    - 197
  - - 8138
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.890969'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.890969'

    - 197
  - - 8139
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.898288'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.898288'
    - That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.
    - Melchior says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of
      the team members.
    - 197
  - - 8140
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.903206'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.903206'
    - "(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)"
    - You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with
      a surprise and Melchior hands you a present.
    - 197
  - - 8141
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.923876'

    - That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.
    - Melchior says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give
      her an answer.

    - We need a decent level of personal performance.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.931252'
    - I've never dreamt about soccer.
    - Metatron, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams,
      about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about
      it.
    - 198
  - - 8144
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.934619'

    - 198
  - - 8145
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.937580'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.937580'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Metatron is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that
      can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 198
  - - 8146
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.940657'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.940657'
    - Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.946632'
    - Metatron? Nah, she never gets lost.
    - It seems that Metatron is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
    - 198
  - - 8148
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.951213'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.951213'
    - Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
    - You find Metatron lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What
      should we say?
    - 198
  - - 8149
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.967957'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.967957'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Metatron says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She
      thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
    - 198
  - - 8150
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.985797'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.985797'
    - We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very
      severe fever. What should we do?
    - 198
  - - 8151
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.988777'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.988777'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Metatron wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should
      we do?
    - 198
  - - 8152
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.992004'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.992004'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
    - Metatron caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What
      should we do?
    - 198
  - - 8153
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.997474'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:35.997474'
    - Let's try out some forward passes.
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Metatron some
      orders.
    - 198
  - - 8154
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.001661'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.001661'
    - It's time we use him as training material.
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 198
  - - 8155
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.017147'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.017147'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Metatron seems to be worried.
    - 198
  - - 8156
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.020638'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.020638'

      approach from a distance.
    - 198
  - - 8158
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.027492'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.027492'
    - It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
    - Metatron is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say
      to cheer her up?
    - 198
  - - 8159
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.030709'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.030709'
    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Metatron seems to be sick of this.
    - 198
  - - 8160
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.033843'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.033843'

    - 198
  - - 8161
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.036703'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.036703'
    - Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their
      free time.
    - The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with
      Metatron to set some simple rules.
    - 198
  - - 8162
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.040045'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.040045'
    - Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!
    - You come across Metatron, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the
      game. Let's cheer her up.
    - 198
  - - 8163
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.044791'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.044791'
    - I'm not comfortable with this conversation.
    - Metatron is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
    - 198
  - - 8164
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.050023'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.050023'
    - To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
    - Metatron, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding
      that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?
    - 198
  - - 8165
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.053942'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.053942'
    - Let's do our best until the very end!
    - Metatron says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's
      give her an answer.
    - 198
  - - 8166
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.069246'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.069246'
    - I won't rely on Spirit Stones.
    - You're having a conversation with Metatron about the power of Spirit Stones
      which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.
    - 198
  - - 8167
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.072694'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.072694'
    - I like what you just said.

    - 198
  - - 8168
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.075807'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:36.075807'
    - It's a place to rest for the good.
    - Let's talk to Metatron who recently started to take interest in the world of
      angels.

    - I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
    - You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about

    - 201
  - - 8236

      do?

      not our fault.

      a match against your team. Miho seems to be worried.

    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going

    - You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.
    - Miho is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't

    - Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you.
    - Miho, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and
      says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?

    - "(Maybe she brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)"
    - Miho wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string

      go down no matter how many shots he makes.
    - 209
  - - 8582
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:39.065400'

  - - 8583
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:39.068249'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:39.068249'
    - A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling
      into chaos?
    - With a serious face, Min is asking what the true meaning of competition is.
      Let's give him an answer.
    - 209
  - - 8584
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:39.071286'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:39.078394'
    - As long as we're not used as training material...
    - The team is having a good run and Min is sure that winning the League is a matter
      of time.
    - 209
  - - 8587
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:39.081687'

      talk with him.
    - 209
  - - 8590

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:39.090806'
    - Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.

      to do.

    - Wasn't that a glitch?
    - During a match, Min bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems

    - Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?
    - You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Momo's rival, has been severely

    - There will always be a place for you to return.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:40.076020'

      such stories.

      of the king.

      go down no matter how many shots she makes.
    - 213
  - - 8762
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:40.084470'

    - You bring the best out of the team. Good work!
    - Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Morgana is asking how she did in
      the match.
    - 214

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:40.087161'
    - I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things
      to watch.

    - Think about your teammates that are counting on you.
    - Morgana is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate
      emotion she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What
      should we say?
    - 214
  - - 8766
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:40.098273'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:40.117529'
    - It's experiences like this that bonds us together.
    - Morgana did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks
      sad. We should say something to her.
    - 214
  - - 8769
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:40.120176'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:40.120176'

    - They all need scolding.
    - It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking

    - To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
    - Morgana, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding

    - I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
    - You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about
      their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:40.275596'

      our names.
    - Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Moritz on which player
      you think has the brightest future. What will you say?

    - I can't pick just one...
    - Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Nari on which player
      you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
    - 224
  - - 9166
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:41.966290'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:41.990282'
    - Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!

      we do?
    - 224
  - - 9175
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:41.994194'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:41.994194'

    - Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.014662'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.018758'

      Nari.
    - 224
  - - 9179

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.021863'

      such stories.

      of the king.

      go down no matter how many shots she makes.
    - 224
  - - 9182
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.031197'

    - 224
  - - 9183
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.034409'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.034409'
    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
    - This was the worst game in your entire life...Nari comes to you to cheer you
      up.
    - 224
  - - 9184
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.037527'

    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Nari is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the
      Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
    - 224
  - - 9186
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.046241'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.046241'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Nari is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
    - 224
  - - 9187
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.050471'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.050471'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.

    - 224
  - - 9188
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.065230'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.065230'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Nari for solutions.
    - 224
  - - 9189
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.068495'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.068495'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.

    - 224
  - - 9190
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.071590'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.071590'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Nari and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 224
  - - 9191
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.074816'

    - 224
  - - 9193
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.081544'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.081544'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.

    - 224
  - - 9194
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.084587'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.084587'
    - Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.

    - 224
  - - 9195
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.087840'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.087840'
    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Nari suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the
      baby angels live.
    - 224
  - - 9196

    - Let's see what you have to say after the match.

      is better off playing foot volleyball.
    - 224
  - - 9197
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.096082'

    - I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
    - You're sick and in bed when Nari and the teammates come to cheer you up. What
      will your response be?
    - 224
  - - 9198
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.100763'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.100763'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
    - The match and the concert that Nari was looking for start at the same time...
    - 224
  - - 9199
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.115349'

    - 224
  - - 9201

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.121820'
    - Looks like we'll have to do without her.
    - The match started and Nari is standing still doing nothing.
    - 224
  - - 9202
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.125090'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.125090'
    - You were picking the other team apart! It was awesome!
    - Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Nebra is asking how he did in the
      match.
    - 225
  - - 9203
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.128642'

      him?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.135195'
    - You don't need to be the one being dragged around.
    - Nebra is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion
      he feels. He says he must leave now to propose to his lover. What should we
      say?
    - 225
  - - 9206
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.138552'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.138552'
    - "*Smiles bitterly*"

    - Sure. Let's get on to it.
    - Nebra is asking for special training sessions because he's not satisfied with
      today's performance. What should we tell him?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.153062'
    - Sorry, I feel that this is on me.
    - Nebra did his best, but he failed to achieve the results he wanted and looks
      sad. We should say something to him.
    - 225
  - - 9209
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.156454'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.156454'

    - Let's make him put on Ogre's underwear.
    - Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk
      with Nebra about what to do with him.

  - - 9212
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.172330'

    - "(Guide him by kicking the ball toward the weak link in the opponent's defense.)"

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.182332'
    - Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.
    - It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking
      up for the morning training. What should we tell Nebra to do?
    - 225
  - - 9216
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.185472'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.185472'

    - 225
  - - 9220
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.202986'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.202986'
    - "(Leave it to Nebra.)"

    - Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.
    - Nebra says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should
      we answer?
    - 225
  - - 9223
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.222209'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.222209'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.497756'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.497756'
    - How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.
    - Nerua suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be
      your reaction?
    - 227
  - - 9284

    - I'm sure it's going in a good direction.
    - As Nerua said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the
      Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
    - 227
  - - 9287
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.549434'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.549434'
    - They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
    - The crowd is cheering for Nerua. Nerua seems to find this situation new and
      a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
    - 227
  - - 9288
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.555563'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.561398'
    - Oh, that'll be so cute!
    - Nerua was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet
      penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
    - 227
  - - 9290
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.588554'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.588554'
    - Hmm, wanna go shopping?
    - The team will not have a match for some time. Nerua asks you about your plan.
    - 227
  - - 9291
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.604489'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.604489'
    - That player must have a heart of gold.
    - It's a very intense match and Nerua falls on the ground, but a player on the
      other team helps Nerua up and the two exchange smiles.
    - 227
  - - 9292
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.610958'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.610958'
    - That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
    - 227
  - - 9293
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.616708'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.616708'
    - How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
    - You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Nerua having an intense staring
      contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
    - 227
  - - 9294
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.624782'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.624782'

    - 227
  - - 9295
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.629855'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.629855'
    - Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
    - Nerua scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate
      her!
    - 227
  - - 9296
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.633195'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.633195'
    - It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
    - A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk
      about this with Nerua.
    - 227
  - - 9297
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.636248'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.636248'
    - Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
    - Nerua falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say
      to her?
    - 227
  - - 9298
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.639368'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.639368'
    - This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
    - Nerua lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
    - 227
  - - 9299
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.644757'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.644757'
    - Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.
    - You come across Sammy while walking the street with Nerua. Let's talk to her.
    - 227
  - - 9300
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.650672'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.650672'
    - They must love volunteer work!
    - Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Nerua is curious
      and wants to take a look.
    - 227
  - - 9301
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.655017'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.655017'
    - The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...
    - Nerua brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team.
      It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
    - 227
  - - 9302
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.665784'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.665784'
    - They were a worthy opponent.
    - Nerua is looking excited and asks how the match went.
    - 227
  - - 9303
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.668877'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.668877'
    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
    - This was the worst game in your entire life...Nerua comes to you to cheer you
      up.
    - 227
  - - 9304
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.672182'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.672182'
    - I would say goodbye to all my friends.
    - You're talking to Nerua about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow.
      Let's tell her your answer.
    - 227
  - - 9305
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.675473'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.675473'
    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Nerua is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in
      the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
    - 227
  - - 9306
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.678765'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.678765'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Nerua is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
    - 227
  - - 9307
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.682012'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.682012'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
    - Nerua isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have
      become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 227
  - - 9308
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.685115'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.685115'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Nerua for solutions.
    - 227
  - - 9309
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.688340'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.688340'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
    - The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
    - 227
  - - 9310
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.692055'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.692055'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Nerua and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 227
  - - 9311
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.697856'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.697856'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 227
  - - 9312
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.703097'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.703097'
    - I thought they were just friends.
    - According to Nerua's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
    - 227
  - - 9313
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.716613'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.716613'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.
    - Nerua thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
    - 227
  - - 9314
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.720522'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.720522'
    - Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
    - Nerua won a trip around the world from a radio event!
    - 227
  - - 9315
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.723777'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.723777'
    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Nerua suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the
      baby angels live.
    - 227
  - - 9316
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.727258'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.727258'
    - Let's see what you have to say after the match.

      is better off playing foot volleyball.
    - 227
  - - 9317
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.730622'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.730622'
    - I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
    - You're sick and in bed when Nerua and the teammates come to cheer you up. What
      will your response be?
    - 227
  - - 9318
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.733763'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.733763'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
    - The match and the concert that Nerua was looking for start at the same time...
    - 227
  - - 9319
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.736915'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.736915'
    - Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
    - Nerua wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
    - 227
  - - 9320
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.740545'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.740545'
    - Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?

    - 227
  - - 9321
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.746512'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.746512'
    - Looks like we'll have to do without her.
    - The match started and Nerua is standing still doing nothing.
    - 227
  - - 9322
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.751055'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.751055'
    - To win all the way, of course.
    - Net is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
    - 228
  - - 9323
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.765812'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.765812'
    - I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
    - Net is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 228
  - - 9324
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.768965'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.768965'
    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Net seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe.
      He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 228
  - - 9325
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.772303'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.772303'
    - You're right. This is a waste of time.
    - Net is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing
      any problems.
    - 228
  - - 9326
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.775776'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.775776'
    - I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some
      advice.
    - 228
  - - 9327
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.779157'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.779157'
    - Cool! Keep it up!
    - Net is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are
      ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 228
  - - 9328
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.782433'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.782433'
    - It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
    - Net is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to him.
    - 228
  - - 9329
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.785858'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.785858'
    - The door's over there.
    - Net is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by
      vicious aliens.
    - 228
  - - 9330
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.789351'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.789351'
    - It can't be perfect every time.
    - Net is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer
      skills.
    - 228
  - - 9331
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.795251'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.795251'
    - How about we play baseball today?
    - Net is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to him?
    - 228
  - - 9332
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.804705'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.804705'
    - There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Net is complaining that we're up against an opponent
      that's too strong.
    - 228
  - - 9333
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.808259'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.808259'
    - It's your fault.
    - You forgot to lock Net and almost used him as training material! He looks very
      upset!
    - 228
  - - 9334
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.819474'

    - 228

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.822648'
    - Something full of excitement!
    - Net is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start
      soccer. Let's join them.
    - 228
  - - 9336
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.825872'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.825872'
    - His love towards soccer is real.
    - The team is saying bad things about Net for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 228
  - - 9337
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.829322'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.829322'

    - Net is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of
      the Iron Canyon.
    - 228
  - - 9338
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.832488'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.832488'
    - It'll be alright. Don't worry.
    - Net seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel.
      Let's talk to him.
    - 228
  - - 9339
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.835586'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.835586'
    - If you find a beautiful woman, try talking to her!
    - On a day off, Net is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
    - 228
  - - 9340
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.838787'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.838787'
    - "(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)"
    - Net is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What
      do you tell him?
    - 228
  - - 9341
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:42.843664'

    - 232
  - - 9519

    - Drink it up!
    - Noa brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team.

    - 232
  - - 9522
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.734207'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.734207'
    - You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.
    - Noa is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't
      expecting this, but you should give her an answer.
    - 232
  - - 9523
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.737250'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.740977'
    - Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you.
    - Noa, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and
      says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?
    - 232
  - - 9525
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.748581'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.748581'
    - "(Maybe she brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)"
    - Noa wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory,
      and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?
    - 232
  - - 9526
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.753209'

  - - 9534

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.794717'

    - 232
  - - 9535
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.798598'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.798598'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.825302'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.834553'
    - Why don't you join them and find out?

      we answer?
    - 233
  - - 9545
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.837192'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.837192'
    - Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
    - Ogre is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time
      thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.
    - 233
  - - 9546
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.839844'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.847783'
    - Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
    - This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want
      to do?
    - 233
  - - 9549
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.867152'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.870158'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.875453'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.878707'
    - Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
    - It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying
      his baby brother is born. What should you do?
    - 233
  - - 9554
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.881781'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.881781'

    - 233
  - - 9555
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.884744'

    - 233

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.887917'

    - 233

    - 233

    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
    - This was the worst game in your entire life...Ogre comes to you to cheer you
      up.
    - 233
  - - 9564
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.929045'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.929045'
    - I would say goodbye to all my friends.

    - 233
  - - 9565
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.932239'

    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Ogre is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the
      Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.
    - 233
  - - 9566
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.935319'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.935319'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Ogre is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
    - 233
  - - 9567
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.938440'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.938440'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
    - Ogre isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have
      become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 233
  - - 9568
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.944348'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.944348'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Ogre for solutions.
    - 233
  - - 9569
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.950256'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.950256'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
    - The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
    - 233
  - - 9570
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.953641'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.953641'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Ogre and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 233
  - - 9571
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.966746'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.966746'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 233
  - - 9572
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.970030'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.970030'
    - I thought they were just friends.
    - According to Ogre's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
    - 233
  - - 9573
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.973217'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.973217'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.
    - Ogre thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
    - 233
  - - 9574
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.976639'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.976639'

    - 233
  - - 9575
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.980129'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.980129'
    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Ogre suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the
      baby angels live.
    - 233
  - - 9576
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.983238'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:43.983238'
    - Let's see what you have to say after the match.
    - The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team
      is better off playing foot volleyball.
    - 233
  - - 9577

    - Iron Claw!

    - You don't need to be the one being dragged around.
    - Ortega is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:44.266234'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:44.299966'
    - Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.
    - It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking
      up for the morning training. What should we tell Ortega to do?
    - 235

    - Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.
    - Paulina is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that
      can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 238
  - - 9766
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:44.970192'

    - 238
  - - 9768

    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Paulina some
      orders.
    - 238
  - - 9774
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.002782'

    - Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Paulina!
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Paulina seems to be sick of this.
    - 238

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.074019'

    - It's finally time for some festival-soccer!

  - - 9802

    - It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.

    - 239
  - - 9819
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.269036'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.269036'
    - We'll win next time!

  - - 9821
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.274322'

    - Drink it up!
    - Pei Lin brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.280382'
    - I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background.
      Are you interested in hearing about it?
    - Phil is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 240

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.285532'

      any problems.
    - 240

      advice.
    - 240
  - - 9827
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.290852'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.290852'
    - I..Respect your naming taste...
    - Phil is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are
      ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 240
  - - 9828
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.295047'

      vicious aliens.
    - 240
  - - 9830
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.316396'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.335873'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.349808'
    - What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.

      yourself.

    - Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.

    - It's within our grasp.
    - Princess Meiran seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best

    - 243
  - - 9954
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.832727'

    - Do you really think that she would skip practice?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.868457'
    - Let's split up and find the uniforms.
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 243
  - - 9962
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.871091'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.879514'
    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Princess Meiran is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing
      in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
    - 243
  - - 9966
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.882151'

    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Princess Meiran is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved

    - 243
  - - 9968
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.887541'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.894119'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Princess Meiran and came across
      Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 243
  - - 9971

    - 243
  - - 9972
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.915722'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.933083'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.

      same time...

    - 243
  - - 9982
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:45.946081'

      a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
    - 247

    - 247

    - I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.523237'
    - Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies
      like I told you...

    - 247
  - - 10119
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.526265'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.567924'

      to do.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.670219'

      orders.

      be achieved. What should we say to him?
    - 248
  - - 10186
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.815279'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.829918'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.

      do?
    - 248
  - - 10192
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.832598'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.832598'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.841152'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Ray seems to be worried.

    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going

    - You don't need to be the one being dragged around.
    - Renee is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion
      she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What should
      we say?
    - 249
  - - 10206
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.890206'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.897992'
    - Sorry, I feel that this is on me.

  - - 10209
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.914990'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:46.914990'

    - Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.
    - It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking
      up for the morning training. What should we tell Renee to do?
    - 249
  - - 10216

    - The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...
    - Ronald brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other
      team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of
      it.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.169652'

    - 255
  - - 10482
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.229403'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.229403'
    - To win all the way, of course.

      her?
    - 256
  - - 10483

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.232506'
    - I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
    - Rosaria is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...

    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Rosaria seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the

    - 256
  - - 10488
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.250318'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.267206'

      soccer skills.
    - 256

    - 256
  - - 10493
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.278299'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.278299'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.289584'
    - Her love towards soccer is real.
    - The team is saying bad things about Rosaria for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 256
  - - 10497
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.293498'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.293498'

    - 256
  - - 10498

    - It'll be alright. Don't worry.
    - Rosaria seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a
      quarrel. Let's talk to her.

  - - 10499
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.315700'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.315700'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.318622'

    - "(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)"

    - 256
  - - 10501

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.321457'
    - It's finally time for some festival-soccer!
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 256
  - - 10502
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.324437'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.324437'
    - They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.

    - 256
  - - 10503
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.330272'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.330272'
    - A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling
      into chaos?
    - With a serious face, Rosaria is asking what the true meaning of competition
      is. Let's give her an answer.
    - 256
  - - 10504
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.334151'

    - Just please go with that boring strategy.
    - Rosaria came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's
      boring strategy. What should we say?
    - 256
  - - 10505
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.351283'

      a matter of time.
    - 256
  - - 10507

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.357225'
    - Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)
    - Rosaria seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the
      fate of the universe.
    - 256
  - - 10508
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.367754'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.383801'
    - Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
    - Rosaria is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength
      of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.

    - I'm thinking of opening a shop.
    - Rosaria plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends.
      Let's talk with her.
    - 256
  - - 10512
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.389206'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.389206'
    - I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.
    - It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Rosaria and talk about
      what to do.
    - 256
  - - 10513
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.392918'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.392918'
    - Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!
    - Rosaria seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
    - 256
  - - 10514
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.397577'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.397577'
    - Cool! Awesome!
    - You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed
      up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
    - 256
  - - 10515
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.401196'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.401196'
    - Has he gone mad?
    - Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
    - 256
  - - 10516
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.416648'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.416648'
    - Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.
    - Rosaria's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next
      match. What should we say to her?
    - 256
  - - 10517
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.419430'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.419430'
    - Wasn't that a glitch?
    - During a match, Rosaria bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She
      seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
    - 256
  - - 10518
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.422100'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.422100'
    - I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.
    - Rosaria is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving
      too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
    - 256
  - - 10519
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.425269'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.425269'
    - Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful
      it is.
    - You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading
      through the festive crowd.
    - 256
  - - 10520
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.428500'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.428500'
    - I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.
    - Rosaria is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should
      we say?
    - 256
  - - 10521
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.431359'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.431359'
    - He's obviously obsessed with soccer.
    - Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying
      himself a little too much. Rosaria is starting to get intimidated.
    - 256
  - - 10522
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.434125'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.434125'
    - To win all the way, of course.
    - Rosette is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell
      her?
    - 257
  - - 10523
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.437016'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.437016'
    - I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
    - Rosette is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 257
  - - 10524
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.440056'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.440056'
    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Rosette seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the
      universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 257
  - - 10525
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.444546'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.444546'
    - You're right. This is a waste of time.
    - Rosette is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing
      any problems.
    - 257
  - - 10526
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.449014'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.449014'
    - I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some
      advice.
    - 257
  - - 10527
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.466233'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.466233'
    - Cool! Keep it up!
    - Rosette is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options
      are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 257
  - - 10528
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.469242'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.469242'
    - It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
    - Rosette is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to her.
    - 257
  - - 10529
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.472067'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.472067'
    - The door's over there.
    - Rosette is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive
      by vicious aliens.
    - 257
  - - 10530
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.475404'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.475404'
    - It can't be perfect every time.
    - Rosette is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their
      soccer skills.
    - 257
  - - 10531
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.478500'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.478500'
    - How about we play baseball today?
    - Rosette is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What
      should we say to her?
    - 257
  - - 10532
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.481570'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.481570'
    - There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Rosette is complaining that we're up against an
      opponent that's too strong.
    - 257
  - - 10533
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.484356'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.484356'
    - It's your fault.
    - You forgot to lock Rosette and almost used her as training material! She looks
      very upset!
    - 257
  - - 10534
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.487586'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.487586'
    - Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!
    - Rosette is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
    - 257
  - - 10535
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.490572'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.490572'
    - Something full of excitement!
    - Rosette is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't
      start soccer. Let's join them.
    - 257
  - - 10536
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.495770'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.495770'
    - Her love towards soccer is real.
    - The team is saying bad things about Rosette for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 257
  - - 10537
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.503551'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.503551'
    - I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.
    - Rosette is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies
      of the Iron Canyon.
    - 257
  - - 10538
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.516557'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.516557'
    - It'll be alright. Don't worry.
    - Rosette seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a
      quarrel. Let's talk to her.
    - 257
  - - 10539
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.519670'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.519670'
    - If you find a handsome man, try talking to him!
    - On a day off, Rosette is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
    - 257
  - - 10540
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.522434'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.522434'
    - "(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)"
    - Rosette is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe.
      What do you tell him?
    - 257
  - - 10541
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.525615'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.525615'
    - It's finally time for some festival-soccer!
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 257
  - - 10542
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.529070'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.529070'
    - You were picking the other team apart! It was awesome!
    - Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Rosette is asking how she did in
      the match.
    - 257
  - - 10543
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.532156'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.532156'
    - I like puppies. The loyal ones!
    - Rosette looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around
      and asks you what kind of pet you like.
    - 257
  - - 10544
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.535161'

      her?
    - 257

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.538177'
    - You don't need to be the one being dragged around.
    - Rosette is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate
      emotion she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What
      should we say?
    - 257
  - - 10546
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.541542'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.541542'
    - "*Smiles bitterly*"

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.546453'
    - Sure. Let's get on to it.
    - Rosette is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied
      with today's performance. What should we tell her?
    - 257
  - - 10548
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.550395'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.550395'
    - Sorry, I feel that this is on me.
    - Rosette did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks
      sad. We should say something to her.
    - 257
  - - 10549
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.566441'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.566441'

    - Let's make him put on Ogre's underwear.
    - Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk
      with Rosette about what to do with him.
    - 257
  - - 10552
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.575702'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.575702'
    - "(Guide her by kicking the ball toward the weak link in the opponent's defense.)"

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.578593'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.584424'
    - Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.
    - It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking
      up for the morning training. What should we tell Rosette to do?
    - 257
  - - 10556
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.587709'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.587709'
    - We shouldn't throw away food. Let's give it to somebody else.
    - Rosette says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?
    - 257
  - - 10557
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.590707'

    - "(Step on the referee's foot and pretend it was an accident.)"

    - 257

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.595669'

    - 257
  - - 10560

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.625981'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.645638'
    - Oh, that'll be so cute!
    - Rudiel was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet
      penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
    - 258
  - - 10570
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.649880'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.649880'
    - Hmm, wanna go shopping?
    - The team will not have a match for some time. Rudiel asks you about your plan.
    - 258
  - - 10571
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.665654'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.665654'
    - That player must have a heart of gold.
    - It's a very intense match and Rudiel falls on the ground, but a player on the
      other team helps Rudiel up and the two exchange smiles.
    - 258
  - - 10572
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.668357'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.668357'
    - That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
    - 258
  - - 10573
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.670958'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.670958'
    - How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
    - You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Rudiel having an intense staring
      contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
    - 258
  - - 10574
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.673547'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.673547'
    - Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.

    - 258
  - - 10575
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.676446'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.676446'
    - Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
    - Rudiel scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate
      her!
    - 258
  - - 10576
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.679362'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.679362'
    - It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
    - A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk
      about this with Rudiel.
    - 258
  - - 10577
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.681970'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.681970'
    - Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
    - Rudiel falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we
      say to her?
    - 258
  - - 10578
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.684574'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.684574'
    - This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
    - Rudiel lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
    - 258
  - - 10579
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.687311'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.687311'

    - They must love volunteer work!
    - Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Rudiel is curious
      and wants to take a look.
    - 258
  - - 10581
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.694156'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.694156'
    - The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...
    - Rudiel brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team.
      It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
    - 258
  - - 10582
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.698277'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.698277'
    - They were a worthy opponent.

    - 258
  - - 10583
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.715610'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.715610'
    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
    - This was the worst game in your entire life...Rudiel comes to you to cheer you
      up.
    - 258
  - - 10584
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.718344'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.718344'
    - I would say goodbye to all my friends.
    - You're talking to Rudiel about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow.
      Let's tell her your answer.
    - 258
  - - 10585
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.720941'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.720941'
    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Rudiel is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in
      the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
    - 258
  - - 10586
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.723750'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.723750'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Rudiel is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
    - 258
  - - 10587
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.727279'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.727279'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
    - Rudiel isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays
      have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 258
  - - 10588
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.730898'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.730898'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Rudiel for solutions.
    - 258
  - - 10589
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.733907'

    - 258
  - - 10590
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.736917'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.736917'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Rudiel and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 258
  - - 10591
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.740052'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.740052'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 258
  - - 10592
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.744011'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.744011'
    - I thought they were just friends.
    - According to Rudiel's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
    - 258
  - - 10593
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.748739'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.748739'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.
    - Rudiel thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
    - 258
  - - 10594
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.765903'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.765903'
    - Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
    - Rudiel won a trip around the world from a radio event!
    - 258
  - - 10595
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.768743'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.768743'
    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Rudiel suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the
      baby angels live.
    - 258
  - - 10596
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.771673'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.771673'
    - Let's see what you have to say after the match.

      is better off playing foot volleyball.
    - 258
  - - 10597
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.774437'

    - I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
    - You're sick and in bed when Rudiel and the teammates come to cheer you up. What
      will your response be?
    - 258
  - - 10598
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.777872'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.777872'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
    - The match and the concert that Rudiel was looking for start at the same time...
    - 258
  - - 10599
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.780873'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.780873'
    - Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
    - Rudiel wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
    - 258
  - - 10600
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.783708'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.783708'
    - Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?

    - 258
  - - 10601
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.786652'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.786652'
    - Looks like we'll have to do without her.
    - The match started and Rudiel is standing still doing nothing.
    - 258
  - - 10602
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.790053'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.790053'
    - To win all the way, of course.
    - Rudy is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
    - 259
  - - 10603
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.794453'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.794453'
    - I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
    - Rudy is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 259
  - - 10604
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.798639'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.798639'
    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Rudy seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe.
      She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 259
  - - 10605
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.818956'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.818956'
    - You're right. This is a waste of time.
    - Rudy is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing
      any problems.
    - 259
  - - 10606
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.821931'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.821931'
    - I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some
      advice.
    - 259
  - - 10607
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.824931'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.824931'
    - Cool! Keep it up!
    - Rudy is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are
      ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 259
  - - 10608
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.828285'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.828285'
    - It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
    - Rudy is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to her.
    - 259
  - - 10609
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.831231'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.831231'
    - The door's over there.
    - Rudy is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive
      by vicious aliens.
    - 259
  - - 10610
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.838696'

    - It can't be perfect every time.
    - Rudy is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer
      skills.
    - 259
  - - 10611
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.841993'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.841993'
    - How about we play baseball today?
    - Rudy is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to her?
    - 259
  - - 10612
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.846463'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.846463'
    - There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Rudy is complaining that we're up against an opponent
      that's too strong.
    - 259
  - - 10613
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.850167'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.850167'
    - It's your fault.
    - You forgot to lock Rudy and almost used her as training material! She looks
      very upset!
    - 259
  - - 10614
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.866850'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.869790'
    - Something full of excitement!
    - Rudy is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't

    - 259
  - - 10616
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.872409'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.872409'
    - Her love towards soccer is real.
    - The team is saying bad things about Rudy for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 259
  - - 10617
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.875300'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.875300'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.878513'
    - It'll be alright. Don't worry.
    - Rudy seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel.
      Let's talk to her.
    - 259
  - - 10619
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.881345'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.881345'
    - If you find a handsome man, try talking to him!
    - On a day off, Rudy is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
    - 259
  - - 10620
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.884137'

    - 259
  - - 10621

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.886871'
    - It's finally time for some festival-soccer!
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 259
  - - 10622
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.889685'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.889685'
    - Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.
    - Rudy says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should
      we answer?
    - 259
  - - 10623
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.893517'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.893517'
    - I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!
    - Rudy asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her
      a sincere answer.
    - 259
  - - 10624
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:48.897481'

    - They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
    - The crowd is cheering for Ryle. Ryle seems to find this situation new and a
      bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.
    - 261
  - - 10688
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.193923'

    - Oh, that'll be so cute!

    - 261

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.221463'
    - That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
    - 261
  - - 10693
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.224232'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.224232'
    - How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
    - You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Ryle having an intense staring
      contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
    - 261
  - - 10694
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.227464'

    - Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?

      him!
    - 261
  - - 10696
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.232979'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.232979'
    - It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.

      to him?

    - 261
  - - 10699
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.240884'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.240884'

    - The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...
    - Ryle brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team.

    - 261
  - - 10702
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.266265'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.277225'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Ryle is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
    - 261

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.438798'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Ryu is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't
      be achieved. What should we say to him?
    - 262
  - - 10746
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.443025'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.443025'
    - Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
    - Ryu wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He
      wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.
    - 262
  - - 10747
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.447168'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.447168'
    - Ryu? Nah, he never gets lost.
    - It seems that Ryu is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
    - 262
  - - 10748
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.450975'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.450975'
    - Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
    - You find Ryu lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should
      we say?
    - 262
  - - 10749
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.465711'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.465711'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Ryu says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks
      Uriel is a very kind angel.
    - 262
  - - 10750
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.468477'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.468477'
    - We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very
      severe fever. What should we do?
    - 262
  - - 10751
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.471155'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.471155'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Ryu wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we
      do?
    - 262
  - - 10752
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.473764'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.473764'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
    - Ryu caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should
      we do?
    - 262
  - - 10753
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.476754'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.476754'
    - Let's try out some forward passes.
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Ryu some orders.
    - 262
  - - 10754
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.479575'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.479575'
    - It's time we use him as training material.
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 262
  - - 10755
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.482394'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.482394'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Ryu seems to be worried.
    - 262
  - - 10756
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.485408'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.485408'
    - I hope that wasn't all you got.
    - Ryu came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
    - 262
  - - 10757
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.488383'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.488383'
    - "...We should get out of here."
    - James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her
      approach from a distance.
    - 262
  - - 10758
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.491194'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.491194'
    - It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
    - Ryu is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer
      him up?
    - 262
  - - 10759
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.495725'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.495725'
    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Ryu seems to be sick of this.
    - 262
  - - 10760
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.499443'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.499443'
    - It's space. Anything can exist here.
    - Ryu looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
    - 262
  - - 10761
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.516081'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.516081'
    - Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their
      free time.
    - The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with
      Ryu to set some simple rules.
    - 262
  - - 10762
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.518827'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.518827'
    - Wow. I'm sooooo happy.
    - The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences.
      Sage asks how you feel. How should we answer?
    - 263
  - - 10763
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.521455'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.521455'
    - How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.
    - Sage suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be
      your reaction?
    - 263
  - - 10764
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.524152'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.524152'
    - "(Pat him on the head.)"
    - Sage is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.
    - 263
  - - 10765
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.527277'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.527277'
    - I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.
    - Sage has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side.
      He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.
    - 263
  - - 10766
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.531151'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.531151'
    - I'm sure it's going in a good direction.
    - As Sage said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the
      Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.
    - 263
  - - 10767
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.534000'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.534000'
    - They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
    - The crowd is cheering for Sage. Sage seems to find this situation new and a
      bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.
    - 263
  - - 10768
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.536894'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.536894'
    - I am so thankful to them.
    - Sage is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to
      him.
    - 263
  - - 10769
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.539703'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.539703'
    - Oh, that'll be so cute!
    - Sage was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin
      himself. Let's talk to him.
    - 263
  - - 10770
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.543539'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.543539'
    - Hmm, wanna go shopping?
    - The team will not have a match for some time. Sage asks you about your plan.
    - 263
  - - 10771
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.547536'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.547536'
    - That player must have a heart of gold.
    - It's a very intense match and Sage falls on the ground, but a player on the
      other team helps Sage up and the two exchange smiles.
    - 263
  - - 10772
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.565486'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.565486'
    - That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
    - 263
  - - 10773
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.568286'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.568286'
    - How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
    - You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Sage having an intense staring
      contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
    - 263
  - - 10774
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.570908'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.570908'
    - Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
    - Sage is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.
    - 263
  - - 10775
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.573571'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.573571'
    - Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
    - Sage scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate
      him!
    - 263
  - - 10776
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.576490'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.576490'
    - It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
    - A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk
      about this with Sage.
    - 263
  - - 10777
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.579322'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.579322'
    - Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
    - Sage falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say
      to him?
    - 263
  - - 10778
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.581969'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.581969'
    - This doesn't look good...Can anybody give him some heals?
    - Sage lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
    - 263
  - - 10779
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.584609'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.584609'
    - Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.
    - You come across Sammy while walking the street with Sage. Let's talk to her.
    - 263
  - - 10780
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.587398'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.587398'
    - They must love volunteer work!
    - Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Sage is curious
      and wants to take a look.
    - 263
  - - 10781
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.590238'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.590238'
    - The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...
    - Sage brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team.
      It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
    - 263
  - - 10782
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.594164'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.594164'
    - You did well and I thank you for that.
    - You find Sage depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer him
      up.
    - 263
  - - 10783
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.598182'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.598182'
    - That's why I need your help.
    - Sage is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem
      yourself.
    - 263
  - - 10784
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.615446'

    - I was always looking forward for that moment.
    - Sage is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's

    - 263
  - - 10786

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.620855'
    - It's just a dream. Forget about it.
    - Sage is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to him.
    - 263
  - - 10787
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.623952'

    - You can overcome this like always. Right?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.630039'
    - Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
    - You come across Sage who is limping. He says it's nothing. What should we do?
    - 263
  - - 10790
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.632860'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.632860'

    - 263
  - - 10791
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.635543'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.635543'
    - What's wrong with her?

      while humming.
    - 263
  - - 10792
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.638371'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.638371'
    - Littre will be fine.
    - Sage looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next
      match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
    - 263
  - - 10793
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.641074'

    - That player is just messing with you.
    - Sage's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Sage
      seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.
    - 263
  - - 10794
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.645285'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.645285'
    - Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
    - Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to
      feel better when he saw Sage.
    - 263
  - - 10795
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.649254'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.649254'

    - 263
  - - 10796
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.666811'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.669664'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.669664'
    - "(Let him take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)"

    - 263
  - - 10798
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.672297'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.672297'
    - They will never learn with an attitude like that.
    - The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played
      dirty. What should we do?
    - 263
  - - 10799
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.674974'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.674974'
    - Well, Sage does have that kind of charm.

    - 263

    - 263
  - - 10801
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:49.680820'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:50.745358'

    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.

      up.
    - 271
  - - 11124
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.151658'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.151658'

    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Scott is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in

    - 271
  - - 11126
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.169240'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.169240'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Scott is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
    - 271
  - - 11127
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.191418'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.191418'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
    - Scott isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have
      become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 271
  - - 11128
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.222513'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.222513'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Scott for solutions.
    - 271
  - - 11129
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.226220'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.226220'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.

    - 271
  - - 11130
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.229828'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.229828'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Scott and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 271
  - - 11131
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.233496'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.233496'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 271
  - - 11132
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.236765'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.236765'
    - I thought they were just friends.
    - According to Scott's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
    - 271
  - - 11133
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.239606'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.239606'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.

    - 271
  - - 11134
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.243359'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.243359'
    - Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.

    - 271
  - - 11135
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.247410'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.247410'
    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Scott suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the
      baby angels live.
    - 271
  - - 11136
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.251002'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.251002'
    - Let's see what you have to say after the match.
    - The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team
      is better off playing foot volleyball.
    - 271
  - - 11137
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.266470'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.266470'
    - I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
    - You're sick and in bed when Scott and the teammates come to cheer you up. What
      will your response be?
    - 271
  - - 11138
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.269235'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.269235'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
    - The match and the concert that Scott was looking for start at the same time...
    - 271
  - - 11139
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.271871'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.271871'
    - Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
    - Scott wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
    - 271
  - - 11140
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.274474'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.274474'
    - Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
    - MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
    - 271
  - - 11141
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.277684'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.277684'
    - Looks like we'll have to do without him.
    - The match started and Scott is standing still doing nothing.
    - 271
  - - 11142
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.280479'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.280479'
    - To win all the way, of course.
    - Sean is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
    - 272
  - - 11143
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.283459'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.283459'
    - I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
    - Sean is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 272
  - - 11144
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.286176'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.286176'
    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Sean seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe.
      He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 272
  - - 11145
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.289348'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.289348'
    - You're right. This is a waste of time.
    - Sean is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing
      any problems.
    - 272
  - - 11146
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.293481'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.293481'
    - I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some
      advice.
    - 272
  - - 11147
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.297943'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.297943'
    - Cool! Keep it up!
    - Sean is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are
      ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 272
  - - 11148
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.316511'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.316511'
    - It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
    - Sean is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to him.
    - 272
  - - 11149
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.319811'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.319811'
    - The door's over there.
    - Sean is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by
      vicious aliens.
    - 272
  - - 11150
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.322870'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.322870'
    - It can't be perfect every time.
    - Sean is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer
      skills.
    - 272
  - - 11151
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.325898'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.325898'
    - How about we play baseball today?
    - Sean is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to him?
    - 272
  - - 11152
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.329536'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.329536'
    - There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Sean is complaining that we're up against an opponent
      that's too strong.
    - 272
  - - 11153
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.332560'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.332560'
    - It's your fault.
    - You forgot to lock Sean and almost used him as training material! He looks very
      upset!

    - 272

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:51.419557'
    - Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!

      crush your team.

      can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 273
  - - 11206

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.733883'
    - I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on

      to her?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.769372'
    - Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies
      like I told you...
    - Sharr lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
    - 278
  - - 11399

    - I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.
    - Sharr says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How
      should we answer?
    - 278
  - - 11403
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.784942'

    - The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.
    - Sharr looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should

    - 278
  - - 11406
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.796436'

    - 278
  - - 11408
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.817631'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.817631'

    - 278

      team members.

      any problems.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.889488'

    - 279
  - - 11428
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.893242'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.897250'

      skills.
    - 279
  - - 11431
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.918171'

    - It's before the 2nd half, and Shu is complaining that we're up against an opponent
      that's too strong.
    - 279
  - - 11433
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.923678'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.923678'
    - It's your fault.
    - You forgot to lock Shu and almost used him as training material! He looks very
      upset!
    - 279
  - - 11434
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.926874'

    - 279

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.932822'
    - His love towards soccer is real.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.935567'

      the Iron Canyon.
    - 279
  - - 11438

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.938740'
    - It'll be alright. Don't worry.
    - Shu seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel.
      Let's talk to him.
    - 279
  - - 11439
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.941766'

    - On a day off, Shu is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
    - 279
  - - 11440
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.946185'

    - "(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)"
    - Shu is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What
      do you tell him?
    - 279
  - - 11441
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.950767'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:52.950767'

      to do.

    - I think that player likes you.
    - Shura's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field.
      Shura seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
    - 280
  - - 11474
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:53.107398'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.095148'
    - Nobody can resist that charm of yours.
    - A defender on the other team seems to have fallen in love with Sophie and is
      chasing her around the field. It looks like the player forgot about the match.
      What should we do?
    - 289
  - - 11855
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.099607'

      to do?
    - 290
  - - 11869
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.171700'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.180996'
    - That must hurt.
    - Ogre's pony tail slapped Sorrow in the face!
    - 290
  - - 11873
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.184036'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.184036'
    - Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
    - It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying
      his baby brother is born. What should you do?
    - 290
  - - 11874
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.187201'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.187201'
    - Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!

      learned something during a match.
    - 290
  - - 11875
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.190293'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.194978'
    - Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing
      the ball.
    - Sorrow says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What
      should we say to her?
    - 290
  - - 11877
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.199367'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.199367'
    - "...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that..."

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.215443'

    - 290
  - - 11879
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.218284'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.218284'
    - A crow?!
    - Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
    - 290
  - - 11880
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.221275'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.221275'
    - It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.

    - 290
  - - 11881
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.224057'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.224057'

    - 290

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.230233'
    - I've never dreamt about soccer.
    - Sorrow, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about
      soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
    - 290
  - - 11884
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.233296'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.233296'

    - 290
  - - 11885

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.236475'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Sorrow is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't
      be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 290
  - - 11886
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.239613'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.239613'

    - 290
  - - 11888
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.248507'

    - 290
  - - 11889
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.265778'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.265778'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Sorrow says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She
      thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
    - 290
  - - 11890
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.268654'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.268654'
    - We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very
      severe fever. What should we do?
    - 290
  - - 11891
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.271286'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.271286'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Sorrow wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should
      we do?
    - 290
  - - 11892
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.273929'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.273929'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
    - Sorrow caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What
      should we do?
    - 290
  - - 11893
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.281746'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.281746'
    - Let's try out some forward passes.
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Sorrow some
      orders.
    - 290
  - - 11894
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.284672'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.284672'
    - It's time we use him as training material.
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 290
  - - 11895
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.287674'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.287674'

      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Sorrow seems to be worried.
    - 290
  - - 11896
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.290537'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.290537'

      approach from a distance.
    - 290
  - - 11898
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.298884'

    - It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
    - Sorrow is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to
      cheer her up?
    - 290
  - - 11899
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.315008'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.315008'
    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Sorrow seems to be sick of this.
    - 290
  - - 11900
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.317747'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.320417'
    - Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their
      free time.
    - The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with
      Sorrow to set some simple rules.
    - 290

    - To win all the way, of course.
    - Stella is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell
      her?
    - 291
  - - 11903
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.326112'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.326112'
    - I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
    - Stella is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 291
  - - 11904
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.329301'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.329301'
    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Stella seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the
      universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 291
  - - 11905
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.332015'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.332015'
    - You're right. This is a waste of time.
    - Stella is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing
      any problems.
    - 291
  - - 11906
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.335088'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.335088'
    - I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some
      advice.

    - Cool! Keep it up!
    - Stella is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are

      Space Shot'', and a few more.

    - It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
    - Stella is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to her.
    - 291

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.345262'
    - The door's over there.
    - Stella is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive
      by vicious aliens.
    - 291
  - - 11910
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.349229'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.349229'
    - It can't be perfect every time.
    - Stella is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their
      soccer skills.
    - 291
  - - 11911
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.365542'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.365542'
    - How about we play baseball today?
    - Stella is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to her?
    - 291
  - - 11912
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.371193'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.371193'
    - There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Stella is complaining that we're up against an
      opponent that's too strong.
    - 291
  - - 11913
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.376368'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.376368'
    - It's your fault.
    - You forgot to lock Stella and almost used her as training material! She looks
      very upset!
    - 291
  - - 11914
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.381566'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.381566'
    - Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!
    - Stella is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
    - 291
  - - 11915
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.385822'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.385822'
    - Something full of excitement!

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.419619'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.419619'
    - Her love towards soccer is real.
    - The team is saying bad things about Stella for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 291
  - - 11917
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.423057'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.423057'

    - Stella is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies
      of the Iron Canyon.
    - 291
  - - 11918
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.428129'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.428129'
    - It'll be alright. Don't worry.
    - Stella seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel.
      Let's talk to her.
    - 291
  - - 11919
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.433896'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.433896'
    - If you find a handsome man, try talking to him!
    - On a day off, Stella is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
    - 291
  - - 11920
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.437486'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.437486'
    - "(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)"
    - Stella is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe.

    - 291
  - - 11921
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.451530'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.451530'
    - It's finally time for some festival-soccer!
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 291
  - - 11922
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.454903'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.454903'
    - This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!
    - The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences.
      Stella asks how you feel. How should we answer?
    - 291
  - - 11923
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.458740'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.458740'
    - Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!
    - Stella suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be
      your reaction?
    - 291
  - - 11924
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.465627'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.465627'

    - 291
  - - 11925
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.471423'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.471423'
    - Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that
      going.
    - Stella has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive
      side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
    - 291
  - - 11926
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.506612'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.506612'
    - It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this
      universe.
    - As Stella said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the
      Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
    - 291

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.510073'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.510073'
    - They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.
    - The crowd is cheering for Stella. Stella seems to find this situation new and
      a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
    - 291
  - - 11928
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.637607'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.637607'
    - I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!

      to her.
    - 291

    - 291
  - - 11930
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.692845'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.692845'
    - We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
    - The team will not have a match for some time. Stella asks you about your plan.
    - 291
  - - 11931
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.698338'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.698338'
    - True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
    - It's a very intense match and Stella falls on the ground, but a player on the
      other team helps Stella up and the two exchange smiles.
    - 291
  - - 11932
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.716515'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.716515'
    - It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
    - 291
  - - 11933
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.719914'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.719914'
    - Save the energy for the match.
    - You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Stella having an intense staring
      contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
    - 291
  - - 11934
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.723374'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.723374'

    - You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!
    - Stella scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate
      her!
    - 291
  - - 11936
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.733116'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.733116'
    - I feel like he's mocking us!
    - A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk
      about this with Stella.
    - 291
  - - 11937
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.736895'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.736895'
    - Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!
    - Stella falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we
      say to her?
    - 291
  - - 11938
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.751950'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.751950'
    - I will avenge you!
    - Stella lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
    - 291
  - - 11939
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.755264'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.755264'
    - We'll win next time!
    - You come across Sammy while walking the street with Stella. Let's talk to her.
    - 291
  - - 11940
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.759165'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.759165'
    - Let's go help them!
    - Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Stella is curious
      and wants to take a look.
    - 291
  - - 11941
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.764840'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.764840'
    - Drink it up!
    - Stella brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team.
      It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
    - 291
  - - 11942
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.768873'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.768873'
    - What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?
    - Sue is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match.
      Let's give her an answer.
    - 292
  - - 11943
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.784533'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.784533'
    - I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.
    - Sue, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about
      soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
    - 292
  - - 11944
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.787788'

    - You'll have to compete with me!
    - Sue announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league
      completely. Let's give her an answer.
    - 292
  - - 11945
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.791169'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.791169'
    - Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.
    - Sue is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't
      be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 292
  - - 11946
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.797391'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.797391'
    - It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.
    - Sue wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She
      wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
    - 292
  - - 11947
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.801776'

    - 292
  - - 11948
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.817452'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.817452'

      we say?

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.820482'
    - Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?

    - 292
  - - 11950
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.823720'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.823720'
    - I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very
      severe fever. What should we do?
    - 292
  - - 11951
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.827280'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.827280'
    - What about just watching?
    - Sue wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we
      do?
    - 292
  - - 11952
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.830476'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.830476'
    - You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.
    - Sue caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should
      we do?
    - 292
  - - 11953
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.833800'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.833800'
    - Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Sue some orders.
    - 292
  - - 11954
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.836989'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.836989'
    - Stop right there, pig!
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 292
  - - 11955
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.840227'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.840227'
    - Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing
      here.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Sue seems to be worried.
    - 292
  - - 11956
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.845709'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.845709'

    - Who could've done such a hideous thing?
    - Sue is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer
      her up?
    - 292
  - - 11959
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.869809'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.869809'
    - Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Sue!
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Sue seems to be sick of this.
    - 292
  - - 11960
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.872863'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.876901'
    - Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!
    - The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with
      Sue to set some simple rules.
    - 292
  - - 11962
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.880415'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.880415'
    - Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
    - Sue is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
    - 292
  - - 11963
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:55.883582'

    - Why don't you join them and find out?
    - Sue wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should

      our names.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.874978'

    - 297
  - - 12174
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.893729'

    - 297

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.975880'
    - Are you giving up before putting up a fight?

      by vicious aliens.
    - 298
  - - 12190
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.979175'

      soccer skills.
    - 298
  - - 12191

    - No, it's not boring.
    - Tersia is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to her?
    - 298
  - - 12192
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.985269'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.985269'
    - Don't give up until the end.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Tersia is complaining that we're up against an
      opponent that's too strong.
    - 298
  - - 12193
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.988705'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.988705'
    - It's my fault.
    - You forgot to lock Tersia and almost used her as training material! She looks
      very upset!
    - 298
  - - 12194
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.993282'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.993282'

    - 298
  - - 12195
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.998523'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:56.998523'
    - I would've been doing something to save the universe.
    - Tersia is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:57.002309'
    - Do you really think that she would skip practice?
    - The team is saying bad things about Tersia for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
    - 298

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:57.779358'
    - I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things
      to watch.
    - Tina looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around
      and asks you what kind of pet you like.

    - It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.

      to her?
    - 304

    - 304
  - - 12439
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.221608'

    - Drink it up!
    - Tria brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team.

    - 304
  - - 12442
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.230994'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.239457'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Tria is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't
      be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 304
  - - 12446
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.243328'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.243328'
    - Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
    - Tria wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She
      wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
    - 304
  - - 12447
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.247513'

    - 304
  - - 12448

      we say?
    - 304

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.271911'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Tria says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks

    - We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very

    - 304
  - - 12451
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.282041'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.282041'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Tria wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we
      do?
    - 304
  - - 12452
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.284971'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.284971'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
    - Tria caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What
      should we do?
    - 304
  - - 12453
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.287966'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.287966'
    - Let's try out some forward passes.
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Tria some orders.
    - 304
  - - 12454
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.291174'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.291174'
    - It's time we use him as training material.
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 304
  - - 12455
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.296315'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.296315'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Tria seems to be worried.

    - It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
    - Tria is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to
      cheer her up?
    - 304
  - - 12459
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.320650'

    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Tria seems to be sick of this.
    - 304
  - - 12460
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.323355'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.338962'
    - Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
    - Trones is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one
      time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.352621'
    - Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
    - This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want
      to do?
    - 305
  - - 12469
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.366905'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.370329'

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.382730'
    - Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
    - It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying
      his baby brother is born. What should you do?
    - 305
  - - 12474
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.386512'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.386512'
    - Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!

      learned something during a match.
    - 305
  - - 12475

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.396084'
    - Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing
      the ball.

      should we say to him?
    - 305

    - I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.889624'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.889624'
    - Every teammate there by my side on the field is special.
    - Upiel is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy
      moments with. Let's give her an answer.
    - 307
  - - 12549
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.895552'

    - Now we're starting to look like a team!
    - You find Upiel being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will
      you react?
    - 307
  - - 12550
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.900529'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.900529'
    - I'll teach you how to meditate to synchronize the breathing with other teammates.

    - 307
  - - 12551

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.916046'
    - I like how all of the Gate Keepers have different characteristics.
    - Upiel is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
    - 307
  - - 12552
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.920769'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.920769'
    - It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.
    - Upiel doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
    - 307
  - - 12553
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.924281'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.924281'
    - Here! I made some cookies with the team.
    - It's Upiel's birthday. Let's give her a present.
    - 307
  - - 12554
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.928106'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.928106'
    - Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!
    - You see Upiel's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Upiel. What should
      we do?
    - 307
  - - 12555
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.931696'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.931696'
    - I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.
    - The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
    - 307
  - - 12556
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.935544'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.935544'
    - Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?
    - You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Upiel's rival, has been severely
      injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?
    - 307
  - - 12557
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.939976'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.939976'
    - There will always be a place for you to return.
    - Upiel comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal
      reasons. What should we say?
    - 307
  - - 12558
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.946636'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.946636'
    - We can overcome this with team effort.
    - Upiel is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with
      Upiel.
    - 307
  - - 12559
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.952075'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.952075'
    - I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear
      such stories.
    - Upiel is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because
      of the king.
    - 307
  - - 12560
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.968907'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.968907'
    - We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the
      ticket.
    - You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Upiel seems to be interested.
    - 307
  - - 12561
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.972295'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.972295'
    - I'll come up with a formation that can bring the best out of everybody.
    - Upiel says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't
      go down no matter how many shots she makes.
    - 307
  - - 12562
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.975728'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.975728'
    - They were a worthy opponent.
    - Upiel is looking excited and asks how the match went.
    - 307
  - - 12563
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.979622'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.979622'
    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
    - This was the worst game in your entire life...Upiel comes to you to cheer you
      up.
    - 307
  - - 12564
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.982963'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.982963'
    - I would say goodbye to all my friends.
    - You're talking to Upiel about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow.
      Let's tell her your answer.
    - 307
  - - 12565
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.987139'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:58.987139'
    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Upiel is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in
      the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
    - 307
  - - 12566
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.007911'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.007911'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Upiel is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
    - 307
  - - 12567
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.029624'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.029624'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
    - Upiel isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have
      become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 307
  - - 12568
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.033329'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.033329'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Upiel for solutions.
    - 307
  - - 12569
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.040527'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.040527'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
    - The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
    - 307
  - - 12570
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.049247'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.049247'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Upiel and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 307
  - - 12571
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.054699'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.054699'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 307
  - - 12572
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.069187'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.069187'
    - I thought they were just friends.
    - According to Upiel's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
    - 307
  - - 12573
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.073290'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.073290'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.
    - Upiel thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
    - 307
  - - 12574
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.078786'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.078786'
    - Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
    - Upiel won a trip around the world from a radio event!
    - 307
  - - 12575
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.087414'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.087414'
    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Upiel suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the
      baby angels live.
    - 307
  - - 12576
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.093294'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.093294'
    - Let's see what you have to say after the match.
    - The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team
      is better off playing foot volleyball.
    - 307
  - - 12577
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.100736'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.100736'
    - I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
    - You're sick and in bed when Upiel and the teammates come to cheer you up. What
      will your response be?
    - 307
  - - 12578
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.105114'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.105114'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
    - The match and the concert that Upiel was looking for start at the same time...
    - 307
  - - 12579
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.117475'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.117475'
    - Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
    - Upiel wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
    - 307
  - - 12580
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.121594'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.121594'
    - Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
    - MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
    - 307
  - - 12581
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.125689'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.125689'
    - Looks like we'll have to do without her.
    - The match started and Upiel is standing still doing nothing.
    - 307
  - - 12582
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.129600'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.129600'
    - We need a decent level of personal performance.
    - Uriel is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's
      match. Let's give her an answer.
    - 308
  - - 12583
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.133424'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.133424'
    - I've never dreamt about soccer.
    - Uriel, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about
      soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
    - 308
  - - 12584
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.137302'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.137302'
    - I have faith in you.
    - Uriel announces that she will become an influential player that changes the
      league completely. Let's give her an answer.
    - 308
  - - 12585
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.141204'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.141204'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Uriel is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't
      be achieved. What should we say to her?
    - 308
  - - 12586
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.147372'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.147372'
    - Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
    - Uriel wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings.
      She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
    - 308
  - - 12587
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.152126'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.152126'
    - Uriel? Nah, she never gets lost.
    - It seems that Uriel is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
    - 308
  - - 12588
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.168434'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.168434'
    - Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
    - You find Uriel lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should
      we say?
    - 308
  - - 12589
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.171866'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.171866'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Uriel says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She
      thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
    - 308
  - - 12590
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.175334'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.175334'
    - We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very
      severe fever. What should we do?
    - 308
  - - 12591
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.179180'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.179180'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Uriel wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we
      do?
    - 308
  - - 12592
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.182857'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.182857'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
    - Uriel caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What
      should we do?
    - 308
  - - 12593
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.187102'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.187102'
    - Let's try out some forward passes.
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Uriel some
      orders.
    - 308
  - - 12594
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.192219'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.192219'
    - It's time we use him as training material.
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 308
  - - 12595
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.199288'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.199288'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Uriel seems to be worried.
    - 308
  - - 12596
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.203674'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.203674'
    - I hope that wasn't all you got.
    - Uriel came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
    - 308
  - - 12597
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.226166'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.226166'
    - "...We should get out of here."
    - James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her
      approach from a distance.
    - 308
  - - 12598
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.231701'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.231701'
    - It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
    - Uriel is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to
      cheer her up?
    - 308
  - - 12599
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.235916'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.235916'
    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Uriel seems to be sick of this.
    - 308
  - - 12600
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.241754'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.241754'
    - It's space. Anything can exist here.
    - Uriel looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
    - 308
  - - 12601
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.248919'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.248919'
    - Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their
      free time.
    - The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with
      Uriel to set some simple rules.
    - 308
  - - 12602
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.256389'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.256389'
    - Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
    - Uriel seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said
      things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
    - 308
  - - 12603
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.268676'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.268676'
    - Being together is enough for me.
    - With a serious face, Uriel is asking what the true meaning of competition is.
      Let's give her an answer.
    - 308
  - - 12604
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.272514'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.272514'
    - I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
    - Uriel came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's
      boring strategy. What should we say?
    - 308

    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.725049'
    - I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
    - Valentine is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 310
  - - 12664
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.730572'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.730572'
    - It's within our grasp.
    - Valentine seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in
      the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 310
  - - 12665
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.737096'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.737096'
    - The honor of our opponent is also important.
    - Valentine is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from
      causing any problems.
    - 310
  - - 12666
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.743258'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.743258'
    - Be true to yourself.
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some
      advice.
    - 310
  - - 12667
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.751843'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.751843'
    - I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
    - Valentine is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options
      are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 310
  - - 12668
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.756120'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.756120'
    - We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.
    - Valentine is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to him.
    - 310
  - - 12669
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.770220'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.770220'
    - Are you giving up before putting up a fight?
    - Valentine is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive
      by vicious aliens.
    - 310
  - - 12670
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.773684'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.773684'
    - This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?
    - Valentine is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their
      soccer skills.
    - 310
  - - 12671
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.777293'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.777293'
    - No, it's not boring.
    - Valentine is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What
      should we say to him?
    - 310
  - - 12672
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.781352'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.781352'
    - Don't give up until the end.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Valentine is complaining that we're up against
      an opponent that's too strong.
    - 310
  - - 12673
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.784710'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.784710'
    - It's my fault.
    - You forgot to lock Valentine and almost used him as training material! He looks
      very upset!
    - 310
  - - 12674
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.788005'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.788005'
    - You deserve it. Well done!
    - Valentine is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
    - 310
  - - 12675
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.793133'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.793133'
    - I would've been doing something to save the universe.
    - Valentine is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't
      start soccer. Let's join them.
    - 310
  - - 12676
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.799043'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.799043'
    - Do you really think that he would skip practice?
    - The team is saying bad things about Valentine for skipping practice. Time to
      intervene.
    - 310
  - - 12677
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.803510'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.803510'

      of the Iron Canyon.
    - 310
  - - 12678
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.816354'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.816354'
    - Let's go look for him.
    - Valentine seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after
      a quarrel. Let's talk to him.
    - 310
  - - 12679
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.819545'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.819545'
    - I'd love to have a stable job first.
    - On a day off, Valentine is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
    - 310
  - - 12680
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.822871'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.822871'
    - "(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)"
    - Valentine is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe.
      What do you tell him?
    - 310
  - - 12681
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.826800'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.826800'
    - Let's split up and find the uniforms.
    - There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes.
      What should you tell the team?
    - 310
  - - 12682
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.830193'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.830193'
    - We need a decent level of personal performance.
    - Valentine is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's
      match. Let's give him an answer.
    - 310
  - - 12683
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.833440'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.833440'
    - I've never dreamt about soccer.
    - Valentine, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams,
      about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about
      it.
    - 310
  - - 12684
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.837822'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.837822'
    - I have faith in you.
    - Valentine announces that he will become an influential player that changes the
      league completely. Let's give him an answer.
    - 310
  - - 12685
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.849379'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.849379'
    - That doesn't change what we must do.
    - Valentine is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that
      can't be achieved. What should we say to him?
    - 310
  - - 12686
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.857157'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.857157'
    - Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
    - Valentine wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings.
      He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.
    - 310
  - - 12687
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.863930'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.863930'
    - Valentine? Nah, he never gets lost.
    - It seems that Valentine is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
    - 310
  - - 12688
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.927623'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.927623'
    - Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
    - You find Valentine lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What
      should we say?
    - 310
  - - 12689
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.936504'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.936504'
    - Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
    - Valentine says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He
      thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
    - 310
  - - 12690
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.943246'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.943246'
    - We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
    - A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very
      severe fever. What should we do?
    - 310
  - - 12691
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.973379'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.973379'
    - That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
    - Valentine wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should
      we do?
    - 310
  - - 12692
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.979189'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.979189'
    - Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
    - Valentine caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice.
      What should we do?
    - 310
  - - 12693
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.985065'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.985065'
    - Let's try out some forward passes.
    - The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Valentine some
      orders.
    - 310
  - - 12694
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.989498'
    - '2017-07-03 04:19:59.989498'
    - It's time we use him as training material.
    - Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making
      a scene.
    - 310
  - - 12695
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.016263'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.016263'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Valentine seems to be worried.
    - 310
  - - 12696
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.022681'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.022681'
    - I hope that wasn't all you got.
    - Valentine came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
    - 310
  - - 12697
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.047438'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.047438'
    - "...We should get out of here."
    - James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her
      approach from a distance.
    - 310
  - - 12698
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.055762'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.055762'
    - It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
    - Valentine is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say
      to cheer him up?
    - 310
  - - 12699
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.061089'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.061089'
    - Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
    - Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going
      to end any time soon. Valentine seems to be sick of this.
    - 310
  - - 12700
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.079890'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.079890'
    - It's space. Anything can exist here.
    - Valentine looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
    - 310
  - - 12701
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.083994'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.083994'
    - Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their
      free time.
    - The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with
      Valentine to set some simple rules.
    - 310
  - - 12702
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.091661'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.091661'
    - They were a worthy opponent.
    - Valkia is looking excited and asks how the match went.
    - 311
  - - 12703
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.101306'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.101306'
    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
    - This was the worst game in your entire life...Valkia comes to you to cheer you
      up.
    - 311
  - - 12704
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.109237'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.109237'
    - I would say goodbye to all my friends.
    - You're talking to Valkia about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow.
      Let's tell her your answer.
    - 311
  - - 12705
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.127078'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.127078'
    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Valkia is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in
      the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
    - 311
  - - 12706
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.131750'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.131750'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Valkia is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
    - 311
  - - 12707
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.137051'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.137051'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
    - Valkia isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays
      have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 311
  - - 12708
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.142877'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.142877'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Valkia for solutions.
    - 311
  - - 12709
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.151594'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.151594'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
    - The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
    - 311
  - - 12710
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.156247'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.156247'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Valkia and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 311
  - - 12711
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.171574'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.171574'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 311
  - - 12712
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.175720'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.175720'
    - I thought they were just friends.
    - According to Valkia's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
    - 311
  - - 12713
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.179742'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.179742'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.
    - Valkia thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
    - 311
  - - 12714
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.184966'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.184966'
    - Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
    - Valkia won a trip around the world from a radio event!
    - 311
  - - 12715
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.189764'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.189764'
    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Valkia suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the
      baby angels live.
    - 311
  - - 12716
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.196665'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.196665'
    - Let's see what you have to say after the match.
    - The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team
      is better off playing foot volleyball.
    - 311
  - - 12717
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.201794'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.201794'
    - I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
    - You're sick and in bed when Valkia and the teammates come to cheer you up. What
      will your response be?
    - 311
  - - 12718
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.219993'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.219993'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
    - The match and the concert that Valkia was looking for start at the same time...
    - 311
  - - 12719
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.223917'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.223917'
    - Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
    - Valkia wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
    - 311
  - - 12720
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.227146'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.227146'
    - Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
    - MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
    - 311

    - To win all the way, of course.

    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Verister seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the
      universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.619535'

    - I think they're also mesmerized by you. You have a charm that matches a demon...
    - Verister is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during
      the match. It's your job to defend your teammates.
    - 313
  - - 12804
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:00.684313'

    - Nobody can resist that charm of yours.
    - A defender on the other team seems to have fallen in love with Verister and
      is chasing her around the field. It looks like the player forgot about the match.

      not our fault.

    - The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.700390'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.700390'
    - What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I'm in heaven'' or something?
    - The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences.

    - 324
  - - 13248

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.737544'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.737544'
    - Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
    - It's a very intense match and William falls on the ground, but a player on the
      other team helps William up and the two exchange smiles.
    - 324
  - - 13252
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.740483'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.740483'
    - I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
    - The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on
      the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.773763'
    - Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies
      like I told you...
    - William lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
    - 324
  - - 13259
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.776995'

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.785698'

    - Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
    - William seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling
      said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.
    - 324
  - - 13263
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.788687'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.788687'

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.791836'
    - I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
    - William came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's
      boring strategy. What should we say?
    - 324

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.796210'
    - Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
    - William is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be
      seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
    - 324
  - - 13266
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.800887'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.800887'
    - Let's keep this momentum going!
    - The team is having a good run and William is sure that winning the League is
      a matter of time.
    - 324
  - - 13267
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.815738'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.815738'
    - Let's open up a bright future with this ball.
    - William seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the
      fate of the universe.
    - 324
  - - 13268
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.819275'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.819275'
    - Don't be weak.
    - William seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
    - 324

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.825565'
    - Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
    - William is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength
      of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
    - 324
  - - 13271
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.828887'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.828887'

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.832129'
    - We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
    - It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with William and talk about
      what to do.
    - 324
  - - 13273
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.835214'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.835214'

    - William seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
    - 324
  - - 13274
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.838460'

    - 324

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.848277'
    - Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.852078'
    - It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.
    - During a match, William bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He
      seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?
    - 324
  - - 13278
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.865033'

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.868148'
    - I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.

      through the festive crowd.
    - 324
  - - 13280
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.871288'

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.874788'
    - Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.
    - Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying
      himself a little too much. William is starting to get intimidated.
    - 324
  - - 13282
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.888121'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.888121'
    - To win all the way, of course.

    - 325
  - - 13283
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.893701'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.893701'
    - I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
    - Wizol is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering
      this...
    - 325
  - - 13284
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.900381'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.900381'
    - "(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)"
    - Wizol seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the
      universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
    - 325
  - - 13285
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.903986'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.903986'
    - You're right. This is a waste of time.
    - Wizol is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing
      any problems.
    - 325
  - - 13286
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.917201'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.917201'
    - I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
    - Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some
      advice.
    - 325
  - - 13287
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.920409'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.920409'
    - Cool! Keep it up!
    - Wizol is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are
      ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral
      Space Shot'', and a few more.
    - 325
  - - 13288
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.923820'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.923820'
    - It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
    - Wizol is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe.
      Let's go talk to him.
    - 325
  - - 13289
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.927464'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.927464'
    - The door's over there.
    - Wizol is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive
      by vicious aliens.
    - 325
  - - 13290
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.930743'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.930743'
    - It can't be perfect every time.
    - Wizol is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer
      skills.
    - 325
  - - 13291
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.934126'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.934126'
    - How about we play baseball today?
    - Wizol is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should
      we say to him?
    - 325
  - - 13292
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.937455'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.937455'
    - There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
    - It's before the 2nd half, and Wizol is complaining that we're up against an
      opponent that's too strong.
    - 325
  - - 13293
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.940918'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.940918'
    - It's your fault.
    - You forgot to lock Wizol and almost used him as training material! He looks
      very upset!
    - 325
  - - 13294
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:02.948077'

      team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of
      it.
    - 328
  - - 13422
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:03.520878'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:03.520878'
    - They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:03.523538'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:03.523538'

      is. Let's give her an answer.
    - 328
  - - 13424
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:03.526752'

    - Just please go with that boring strategy.
    - Xiao Lang came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's
      boring strategy. What should we say?

    - They're on cooldown.
    - Xiao Lang is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to

    - 328
  - - 13426
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:03.532640'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:03.532640'
    - As long as we're not used as training material...

    - Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
    - Xiao Lang is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength
      of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
    - 328
  - - 13431
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:03.550762'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:03.550762'
    - I'm thinking of opening a shop.
    - Xiao Lang plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends.

    - 332
  - - 13622
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:04.420262'

    - 340
  - - 13948
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:05.841465'

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:05.863929'

      we do?
    - 340
  - - 13952

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:05.869319'

      orders.

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:05.874664'
    - It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's
      not our fault.
    - You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during
      a match against your team. Jackson seems to be worried.
    - 340

    - I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things
      to watch.

    - Zach is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion
      he feels. He says he must leave now to propose to his lover. What should we
      say?

  - - 13966
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:05.924796'

    - It's experiences like this that bonds us together.
    - Zach did his best, but he failed to achieve the results he wanted and looks
      sad. We should say something to him.

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.034114'
    - Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
    - It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Zach and talk about what
      to do.
    - 341
  - - 13993
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.037205'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.037205'
    - I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance
      on the field.
    - Zach seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
    - 341
  - - 13994
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.040055'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.040055'
    - Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!
    - You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed
      up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
    - 341
  - - 13995
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.044172'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.044172'
    - I guess he's happy this is a good match.
    - Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
    - 341
  - - 13996
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.048451'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.048451'
    - If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.
    - Zach's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match.
      What should we say to him?
    - 341
  - - 13997
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.066943'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.066943'
    - We have to keep on going.
    - During a match, Zach bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems
      depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?
    - 341
  - - 13998
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.080463'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.080463'
    - Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.087413'
    - If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and
      accept.
    - You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading
      through the festive crowd.

    - All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
    - Zach is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should
      we say?
    - 341
  - - 14001
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.099054'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.099054'
    - This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.
    - Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying
      himself a little too much. Zach is starting to get intimidated.
    - 341
  - - 14002
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.101986'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.101986'
    - They were a worthy opponent.
    - Raklet is looking excited and asks how the match went.
    - 342
  - - 14003
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.114596'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.114596'
    - Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
    - This was the worst game in your entire life...Raklet comes to you to cheer you
      up.
    - 342
  - - 14004
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.117458'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.117458'
    - I would say goodbye to all my friends.
    - You're talking to Raklet about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow.

    - 342
  - - 14005

    - I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
    - Raklet is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in
      the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
    - 342
  - - 14006
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.122744'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.122744'
    - Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
    - Raklet is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams
      that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
    - 342
  - - 14007
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.125848'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.125848'
    - Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
    - Raklet isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays
      have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
    - 342
  - - 14008
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.128941'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.128941'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Raklet for solutions.
    - 342
  - - 14009
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.131683'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.131683'
    - Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
    - The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
    - 342
  - - 14010
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.134318'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.134318'
    - Let's give her some space.
    - You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Raklet and came across Enthia
      standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.
    - 342
  - - 14011
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.137308'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.137308'
    - This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 342
  - - 14012
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.140155'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.140155'
    - I thought they were just friends.
    - According to Raklet's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
    - 342
  - - 14013
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.144276'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.144276'
    - First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.

    - 342
  - - 14014
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.148704'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.148704'
    - Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
    - Raklet won a trip around the world from a radio event!
    - 342
  - - 14015
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.165475'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.165475'
    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Raklet suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the
      baby angels live.
    - 342
  - - 14016
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.168208'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.168208'

      is better off playing foot volleyball.
    - 342
  - - 14017
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.171012'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.171012'
    - I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
    - You're sick and in bed when Raklet and the teammates come to cheer you up. What
      will your response be?
    - 342
  - - 14018
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.173810'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.173810'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
    - The match and the concert that Raklet was looking for start at the same time...
    - 342
  - - 14019
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.176911'

    - 342
  - - 14020
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.179721'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.179721'

    - 342
  - - 14021
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.182422'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.182422'
    - Looks like we'll have to do without her.
    - The match started and Raklet is standing still doing nothing.
    - 342
  - - 14022
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:06.185112'

    - As pathetic as they are, let's let this one slide.
    - Raklet is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during

    - I've never seen you so excited! You did a great job out there!
    - Being too excited, Raklet is overreacting while talking about the game. It seems
      she wants people to agree with her.

    - Come to me! I'll take care of it!
    - A defender on the other team seems to have fallen in love with Raklet and is
      chasing her around the field. It looks like the player forgot about the match.

    - Drink it up!
    - Edward brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other

      it.
    - 349
  - - 14302
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.469506'

      a matter of time.
    - 349
  - - 14307

    - Edward seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate
      of the universe.
    - 349
  - - 14308
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.488324'

    - It's surprising to see such advanced technology.

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.538571'

    - 350
  - - 14328
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.580589'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.580589'
    - I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
    - With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Zhen Long for
      solutions.
    - 350
  - - 14329

    - 350
  - - 14330

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.586901'
    - Let's give her some space.

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.591045'

    - Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
    - 350
  - - 14332
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.596292'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.596292'
    - I thought they were just friends.

    - That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
    - Zhen Long suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that
      the baby angels live.
    - 350
  - - 14336

      What will your response be?
    - 350
  - - 14338
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.629779'
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.629779'
    - I'm sorry that you couldn't go.

    - 350
  - - 14339
    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.633794'

    - '2017-07-03 04:20:07.640777'
    - Looks like we'll have to do without him.
    - The match started and Zhen Long is standing still doing nothing.
